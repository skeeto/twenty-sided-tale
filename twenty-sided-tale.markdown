% Twenty Sided Tale
% Shamus Young; Heather Young

This is a running narrative of our Dungeons & Dragons campaign. This
is a custom campaign written by me, using the 3.5 edition rules. Our
group meets at my house Sunday evenings and usually plays for about 5
hours. I run the session while my wife transcribes events as they
unfold. After the session I go over our notes (both her live notes and
my pre-game notes) and turn them into the story you read here.

This means that what you read is a collaboration between myself and
six other people. I design the plot and enforce the rules, but the
five players decide how the heroes deal with (or avoid) the challenges
they encounter. Finally, the chaos is turned into what is hopefully an
interesting narrative.

This is our third campaign together. The other two campaigns are not
on-line, although if there is some demand I may post them. All of the
characters are currently level 5 at the start of this campaign. The
current active players are Skeeve the Wizard, Eomer the Rogue, Thordek
the Fighter, Thu'fir the Blade Lord, and Enoch the Cleric.

The campaigns I run are usually a bit more low-key and realistic than
your average D&D story. So, likely as not you'll see Orcs, Goblins,
and Zombies, but I doubt we'll have stuff like gelatenous cubes,
mimics, or dimensional grabbers. Towns are filled with commoners, not
extraplaner travelers. You won't see any talking swords in my world,
and dragons are very, very rare. True magic users are about as rare as
celebreties or pro atheletes in our world. Commoners are aware of
magic and deal with it from time to time, but they don't see it every
day. This is just a style thing. I find the world easier to visualize
if it looks a bit more like our world. I have a hard time imagining
how warfare and commerce would work if a good portion of the populace
could teleport or fly around on pet hippographs. This rule change is
the sort of thing I'm talking about.

I'm writing this campaign because I'd like to see other people doing
this sort of thing. Perhaps it will catch on? I'd love to read the
campaigns other people come up with. If you blog a campaign like this,
please email me and let me know. I'd love to read what you have, and
I'd be glad to add you to the links.

## Mar Tesaro

Mar Tesoro is the setting of our current campaign. It is a large
island (It would take a little better than a week to walk from the
north shore to the south) that is inhabited by two seperate groups:
The Northerners (also called "Lormanites"), and the Alidians.

![](images/map_mar_tesaro.gif)

On the south side of the island is a mountain called "Mount Khelberg".
It is apparently a very large and valuable mountain that contains a
lot of precious metals and gems. From what the party has gathered, the
war seems to be over who should control the mountain.

## Introduction

The characters are in the town of Golgotha. It is late in the month of
Suncrest (July). They just helped the city fend off an army of undead,
saved everyone, and became the big heroes, thus ending the last
campaign. The battle ended three days ago and they have been resting
since then. The battle destroyed and burned down a good bit of the
town, which is now being rebuilt.

The current party is Skeeve the Wizard, Eomer the Rogue, Thordek the
Fighter, and Enoch the Cleric. Lucian the ranger is still part of the
group, but that character is being retired (replaced) with another one
in the first session.

## Endo

![](images/pc_endo.jpg)

| Name: Endo
| Race: Human
| Class: Monk
| Played By: Shamus (Endo is an NPC when I'm the DM)

Endo is a follower of the Ki-Tan fighting style. He lived in Highstone
Monastery, a large stone structure overlooking the town of Bridgehold
in Grey Moor. The town and the monastery formed a sort of symbiotic
relationship. The Monks guarded the town (so traditional town guards
were not needed) while the townies provided food and clothing for the
monks.

Over a few generations various misunderstandings led to quite a bit of
animosity between the two, and eventually they came to resent each
other. The story is too long to relate here, but the short of it is
that at the time of our story it was the custom for select monks to
become "guardians" of the town. As part of their guardianship, they
take a vow of silence and also a vow never to strike (or even
threaten) a resident of the town. After seven years, their
guardianship would end (along with their vows of silence and pacifisim
toward the members of the town) and it was more or less expected that
they would leave the monastery to seek their fortune elsewhere, or
stay and become teachers.

Young men of the city would often take advantage of this vow and taunt
or torment the very guardians that kept them safe from external
threats. (A bit like the way people picked on the Amish in "Witness")
Different monks came up with various ways of dealing with this. One
simply ran when accosted by surly young men in town. Another avoided
coming into town during the day, and instead ran his errands at night.
He would sneak into shops, procure what he needed, and leave the money
on the counter.

Endo had a different way of dealing with it. He stood there and took
it. He would stand still and endure their slaps, insults and spit
until they grew bored and left. Eventually the bullies (there were two
young men who did this) grew angry that they couldn't daunt the monk.
They became more abusive, eventually punching and kicking Endo in an
attempt to get SOME response out of him. Endo never made any attempt
to resist them. They would pummel him until they were exhausted. For
years Endo was covered in cuts and bruises.

As his guardianship drew to a close, the player characters came into
town on their quest. Enoch the cleric encountered Endo on the road and
offered him healing, which Endo silently refused.

There was a counsil at the monastery about the problems that players
faced, and the curse on the land. During the counsil, Endo was
released from his seven-year vow and a new guardian was sworn in. Endo
spoke for the first time in seven years (his voice is very raspy) to
thank his teacher, and then left without hearing the rest of the
proceedings. The meeting was long (lots of talk between the players
and the leaders of the city / monastery) and a lot of the plot was
filled in. Towards the end of the meeting, Endo came in and sat down
without saying a word.

As everyone rose to leave, a couple of townies barged in, breathless,
shouting that Endo had just walked into town and murdered two men.

This was Endo's solution to the bullies in town. He fulfilled his
oath, and the moment it was over he went and snapped the neck and back
of his tormentors. He did NOT do this out of revenge, but out of a
desire to end the violence against guardians. From now on if someone
abused a guardian, he need only stand still and accept it. His passive
attitude would carry a very real implied threat: In seven years I will
kill you.

From that point on, the abuse of guardians ended forever.

In the meantime, there were a lot of sore feelings in town about what
Endo had done. It was decided that he should leave town and travel
with the party as a guide through the mountains.

## Eomer

![](images/pc_eomer.jpg)

| Name: Eomer
| Race: Human
| Class: Rogue
| Played By: Pat

Eomier Abrin DeCauste was born to a soldier, Claudius. While he was
not afforded luxury, he was not deprived either. By means of his
father he was taught at the only established school on the island,
which in those times was almost always a church, and this school was
no different.

He was often told not only by his father, but at the school, of the
crusades of Ubrin Lorich. Three generations had passed since Ubrin and
his companions freed the isle of Grey Moor from its natural occupants;
the orcs. These stories were grand, elaborate and verbose. I will not
burden your ear with the stories in full Elvish song, but know that to
the children of Greymoor these songs were as intoxicating as fine
wine. Idolization of Ubrin and his friends was assured.

"Ubrin had, with the aid of his friends, hunted down and killed every
tribe of orc on the island. Afterwards he declared Grey Moor a free
island, that no man should ever rule it. None but those who sought to
take from others should be turned away from its shores. Like everyone
else, Eomier was astounded that one could be so selfless as to give up
an entire island after conquering it almost single handedly. While
many stories circulated as to why Ubrin had such an acute distaste for
monarchies or established governments, none were ever proven, and no
one really thought it that important.

After Ubrin parted ways with his companions, he constructed the office
of the protector of Grey Moor. He did little but watch the city of
Bayhaven grow around him till his death, save slaying the occasional
band of goblins. He sired and raised a son, Aaron, and instructed him
in the way of the sword and the way of the pen. After his death Aaron
took over stewardship of the island, keeping to his fathers will that
no man should have dominion over another. Aaron lived many years and
saw Bayhaven grow from fledgling town to a city that drew trade ships.
It was during this time that so many races came to settle in Grey
Moor. Despite the usual tensions that exist whenever dwarf, human and
Halfling live in such close proximity, Greymoor and its (lack of)
politics kept these disagreements to a minimum.

It is during Aaron's tenure that the first mention of the Monks of the
Highstone Monastery is made, a passive (but lethal) order of Monks
that had taken stewardship of the local town of Bridgehold. It's not
clear if the town or monastery came first, but since the monks had a
penchant for vows of silence, no one really knows for sure.

No one knows how long the dwarves had been on the island, but it was
also around this time that their presence was discovered.
All-the-while this seemingly uninhabited island was home to a clan of
Dwarven stone masters. Like most dwarves they were very content to
live within their mountain, unburdened with anything outside of it.
Little was heard from the dwarves, but Aaron did arrange a reasonable
trade of goods and foods (mostly ale and textiles) from off-island for
whatever valuables the dwarves were willing to part with.

Aaron knew that once word of trade with Dwarven miners spread that the
trade ships would be more eager to stop at this once small port.
Peoples from all over Mar Talos soon came to find their fortunes in
the mountains that cut the island in half, find adventure in the
north, to free themselves from oppression or to simply claim a strip
of land and make a simple living.

During his time as steward Aaron saw Grey Moor's population grow from
a few hundred to almost ten thousand, with roughly 4 thousand in
Bayhaven alone. This did, however, cost him quite dearly. He invested
much of his families' fortune out of a sense of obligation to his
charge as Protector. Near the end of his wildly successful and
peaceful tenure, he made one error that would eventually engulf the
island in civil war: He levied a tax on ships stopping in port, simply
for upkeep of the docks themselves. While this is customary in all
other ports, this was the first time that such a thing had been done
on Greymoor. Without knowledge or intent, Aaron created a government.
The office of the protector passed to his son, Reginald."

During childhood the fact did not escape Eomier that while there were
more than a few thousand families in Bayhaven, there were less than a
hundred students. This troubled him greatly, and he sought answers.
The head master (and head priest as it was) Tenril at first seemed
annoyed that a boy would question such things, and took it as an
accusation. He rebuked Eomier, and his father was less than pleased.
For 7 years he kept his silence.

By age 11 he was the top student, and his father had advanced to rank
of Lieutenant and personal advisor to Reginald the Protector. One day,
while walking home from school, as he passed the keep he saw his
father and his men taking a young man, not many years older than
Eomier, up to the keep. He looked like he had been roughed up quite a
bit, and the number of guards escorting him suggested whatever his
offense had been, this was a very dangerous man. Eomier asked his
father what the man had done. The man had been caught stealing, and
his punishment would be imprisonment for 2 years, or banishment to the
north. This was basically a death sentence, since no one had come back
from the north in 20 years. He was told of how there would ALWAYS be
people who will take advantage of others if not kept at bay. And that
is what the office of the protector, and in turn Eomier's father, did.
There were always thieves who would pray on the innocent if not dealt
with, and dealt with harshly. This is what Ubrin did, and what he had
envisioned for Grey Moor. Eomier accepted this.

Days later while again walking home from school Eomier was accosted by
several older boys. He did not recognize them and they were much
bigger than him. He did what most boys would do, he ran. Fleeing
through the streets he turned a corner, ducked into a shop and
vanished from his pursuers. As his breath returned, peering out the
window as his attackers passed by, he was startled from a gruff voice
from behind:

"Get used to it kidâ€¦"

He turned around to see a man not as old as his voice would make him
seem. He stood there, frozen, scared and out of breath.

"You don't even know why they're chasing you, do you?"

Eomier shook his head, he had no idea. Eldon informed him that his
father had become quite well known as Reginald's lap dog, making more
than a few enemies. It was the first time he first heard the other
side life on Grey Moor, away from the keep and the school. He heard of
how a few days earlier a man had been imprisoned for trying to sneak a
few things off a ship without paying the tariff first. He had always
paid before; he simply needed to sell the goods first to pay the tax.
Instead he was beaten, jailed, and his goods claimed. The story of an
entire ships crew banished to the North for a mere casket of wine.
Eomier refused to believe it, and left the shop and ran home.

By age 14 he was done with school, and it was time to do what was
expected of him and follow in his fathers footsteps. His first
assignments were simply escorting goods from the port south to the
towns north. He did this often for several months, and it wore on him.
He wished to keep the peace, to defend the people of Grey Moor.

While daydreaming of riding with Ubrin one day, three men jumped from
the bushes along the road and snatched several bags of grain from a
cart right in front of him. Surprised because he wasn't paying
attention, but mostly because these three men hardly looked like the
viscous thieves he was trained to look out for. They were dirty,
ragged, and very obviously starving. They didn't look anything like
the thieves or evil-doers he had imagined, they were starving
peasants. Two of them weren't even wearing shoes. As he watched them
"flee", still quite surprised at their appearance, he watched as all
three were chased down and cut to pieces by other guards on horseback.
Shocked at what had just happened, he said nothing as the Captain
rebuked him for not paying attention. When he returned home, he asked
his father of what had happened, and of his thoughts. Again his father
to reprimanded him for questioning the way of things, and told him to
be more thoughtful of his duty. Troubled by what had happened, he
sought advice from an unlikely source: The shopkeeper.

Eldon was all too eager to fill his ears with stories such as the one
he had seen. And soon Eomier was starting to question exactly who was
oppressing who? Who was the thief? Was he really defending the people?
He struggled with his own ideals and began to see not just the world
he had been shown, but what was hidden behind strong doors and clean
clothes. He used his fathers influence and status (which was now
Magistrate) to look into some of the accusations levied against the
prisoners of the keep. He was shocked to find out that jails were
full, usually for the smallest of offenses, but almost always having
to do with monies owed to the office of the protector. Crimes against
other citizens were dealt with in the harshest manor possible. There
were no rights, no appeals, only the decree of the Protector.

Secretly he began to funnel info to his new friend, Eldon. In turn he
was taught useful skills, and mostly he felt he was only now really
helping people who needed it.

He was still young however, and was soon caught. After a very heated
argument with his father, he left the Office of the Protector and
found work smuggling goods from the north to escape what was now a
ridiculous tax. With every trip back to Bayhaven, a new wing had been
added to the keep. It resembled a castle more than anything, and the
flags of "The Office of the Protector" flew as a King's would.
Eomier's contempt grew every trip.

## Lucian

![](images/pc_lucian.jpg)

| Name: Lucian
| Race: Elf
| Class: Ranger
| Played By: Eric

Lucian has an interesting backstory about betrayal within his family
which sent him into exile (and thus adventuring) but it hasn't really
been introduced in-game.

This character was retired at the end of our second campaign, and Eric
rolled up a new character.

## Skeeve

![](images/pc_skeeve.jpg)

| Name: Skeeve
| Race: Elf
| Class: Wizard
| Played By: Dan

Skeeve is an unusual Wizard. While everyone else had more or less
serious, Tolkien-esque names, Dan gave his Wizard a more comedic name.
Skeeve is also a rustic "farmboy" among Elves, and self-taught himself
magic instead of being an apprentice or joining a guild.

Dan is also pretty outspoken, impulsive, and foul-mouthed. He tends to
blurt out outragous things, to which I reply, "Did you say that in
character?" He'll often reply, "Um. Sure."

So what we ended up with was a very brash Wizard with a penchant for
shooting off his mouth and dropping the F-bomb.

## Yoeg

![](images/pc_yoeg.jpg)

| Name: Yoeg
| Race: Half-Orc
| Class: Barbarian
| Played By: Joe (Retired)

Yoeg's father Keroning (a full orc, and an outcast among his people)
rescued Yoeg's human mother from bandits (possibly rapists). They
lived in the hills in secret and had a son. Some humans found out
about the grotesque union and attacked the house. They slew his father
and mother, and entered the house to find an empty cradle.

Years later (during our first campaign) a Paladin came to Grey Moor,
looking for the Half-Orc. The paladin was large, well-armed, and had
several stout people in his party. Fearing him, the party fled north.

He finally caught up with the party in the town of stackroot. The
paladin revealed that his father was one of the people who attacked
Yoeg's house and killed his parents. Keroning had killed his father,
and the paladin was here to dispense justice and rid the world of the
Orc's vile offspring. He was here to finish the job his father
started.

He promised an honorable fight: If Yoeg would fight him one-on-one,
none of his friends (the other players) would be harmed. The paladin
produced a massive axe, saying he planned on killing the abomination
(Yoeg) with it's fathers own axe.

The fought, and Yoeg killed the paladin. He then took his father's axe
as his own.

At the end of our first compaign, Yoeg remained in Grey Moor.

## Thordek

![](images/pc_thordek.jpg)

| Name: Thordek Earthguard
| Race: Dwarf
| Class: Fighter
| Played By: Joe

Thordek came from a stout family of miners. He worked as a digger in a
family mine for many decades until he was offered a position as forman
in a distant mine. This was his chance to lead the dig, design the
shafts, and be the first to see the secrets the ground had to offer.
He took the job and travelled a great distance to his new home and dig
site. When he arrived, all were dead. They had been slain weeks
earlier. With no owner and no crew there was no job for him. Thodek
left and began to wander the country, seeking work.

He had a number of adventures before coming to Golgotha in northern Dunlock.

> Thodek was an NPC in our second campaign. As the campaign drew to a
> close, Joe (the DM) decided he'd rather try a different character,
> as opposed to playing Yoeg again. He wanted to play a Dwarf, so
> using the already-established character Thordek made sense.

## Enoch

![](images/pc_enoch.jpg)

| Name: Enoch
| Race: Human
| Class: Cleric (serves Pelor)
| Played By: Bogan

Bogan wrote a great backstory for this character way back during out
first campaign. Since then I've managed to misplace it. I'll update
this once I find his story. It's somewhere in my DM notes.

Bogan is quiet, and so Enoch ends up being pretty quiet in-game as
well. He's actually one of the most observant characters, and uses his
spells wisely. He's caught me off guard a few times with suddenly
casting a lesser-known (read: non-combat) spell like "zone of truth"
when I wasn't expecting it. As a DM, I always find it rewarding when
players come up with solutions I hadn't thought of.

## The Setting

Before I became DM, the players were in a campaign run by a guy named
Josh, whom I've never met. They parted ways with him and I ended up
running the campaign. Josh was very much a freestyle DM, with no real
shape to the game world. It was just town, woods, town, woods, in some
non-specific country.

When I took over I wanted to keep a bit of continuity, but at the same
time I needed to place them in some sort of structured world. I came
up with the map you see below. I decided that they all came from
"Dunlock", and they were in the coastal town of Djoshport (named after
their hapless former DM). In our first session I stuck them on a boat
for Grey Moor, the site of our first campaign.

![](images/world_map.gif)

Our "world map" consists of the following:

* Dunlock is the main landmass. The players "come from" here. The
  country doesn't really have much in the way of detail, but serves as
  an anchor for the other lands in the game.
* Grey Moor
* Mar Tesaro
* Mar Talos
* The Tunderlands are inhabited, but the players have never been
  there. This land is open for future adventures.

In our first campain the players went to Grey Moor and broke an evil
curse that was killing the crops and draining the land of life, and
then joined in a battle to prevent a single greedy nobleman for
siezing control of the Island. Along the way they teamed up with Eomer
and Endo and attained level 3. The Elves of Mar Talos joined in the
battle to keep the island free. This brought our first campaign to an
end.

At this point one of the players (Joe) became the DM, and I joined the
game as a normal player using Endo. Joe's character stayed on Grey
Moor, and the rest of us sailed to Golgotha in northern Dunlock. The
party battled an army of the undead, saved the land, and made level 5.
I became the DM again, keeping Endo as an NPC that travelled with the
party. The party sailed for Mar Talos, but got shipwrecked on Mar
Tesaro, which our third campaign is now taking place.

## Session 1, Part 1

### 22nd of Suncrest, 1501dy

The unlikely band of heroes waits impatiently at the inn, for what
they do not know. The town, Golgotha, is swarming with mercenaries but
as heroes the party finds that they do not need to pay for anything.
All they want and more is at their fingertips, yet they itch to be
gone. It has been months since they left Greymoor and some have
unfinished business there awaiting their return.

The inn is nothing more than an abandoned house in view of the docks,
the old inn having been destroyed in the battle three days earlier.
Endo stands in the lobby watching the comings and goings; fighters,
merchants, sailors, thieves, all can be seen walking along the road
near the docks. The docks themselves are a flurry of excitement. A new
ship, rickety and hardly sail worthy, looking to be on its last sails,
is in the dock being stocked full of boxes from the blacksmith shop
down the road.

A young boy runs in the door asking if an Eomer or an Enoch is at the
inn. Endo points toward their rooms. The boy nods and runs off,
disappearing into the depths of the inn.

Moments later the others join Endo in the lobby. Eomer has been given
the following letter:

<div class="document">
Eomer son of Claudius,

We hope you have enjoyed your travels, but the council bids you to
come home and lend aid to our country. We are beset and in need of the
skills of you and your companions. Troubles have come to our land and
we ask that you would remember your obligation to your family and
homeland. Please make haste to the Keep in Bayhaven and we will reveal
what it is you must do.

With Hope,

The Council of Grey Moor
</div>

Enoch also speaks up, saying that he received a letter from Sagemaster:

<div class="document">
To Enoch, Servant of Pelor,

Trusted friend, word may reach your ears of the troubles in Grey Moor.
The Council of Bayhaven has sent word to many allies in search of aid,
and I expect they will contact you as well. I request that you and
your friends come see me in Talosport before visiting the counsil. I
realize this will be an inconvenience to you, and I do not make such a
request lightly. I do promise that what you hear will be to your
advantage. I do not wish to hinder you from acting on events as you
choose, but I would like to advise you before you get involved.

Faithfully,

Sagemaster Teerin Forwinol
</div>

> Grey Moor was the site of their first campaign. They actually set up
> the Council of Grey Moor in the wake of the campaign. Sagemaster
> Teerin is a trusted friend of the PC's and a powerful individual. He
> is the ruler of Mar Talos. (See the map for more details). The party
> is on uneasy terms with the council, but trust Sagemaster a great
> deal.

The party discusses their plans, considering whether to go straight to
Greymoor or to stop at Mar Telos on the way back. Lucian decides to
stay and help the people rebuild their town. Eomer looks sternly at
Lucian and just as sternly says, "Stay away from my girlfriend".

Lucian, known to be a bit of a cad, just grins.

Eomer wanders off to the docks to speak to the boat-masters. After
speaking to several he finds that the only one heading that way is the
Ocean's Majesty, the same decrepit ship Endo had seen being loaded
down with cargo. The captain, Captain Purlof, a rather fat, optimistic
old soul, is on the deck seated upon a large barrel, rocking slowly
back and forth. Behind him stands the XO, First Mate Inorem. He's a
rather sour looking elf, who shows great disdain for everyone,
including the only elf in the party, Skeeve.

Eomer leads the negotiations with the Captain, throughout which Inorem
contends with whatever the Captain says.

Purlof plans to head for Fort Boland on Mar Tesaro, then proceed to
Bayhaven on Grey Moor, and finally to Talosport on Mar Telos. Eomer
asks how much he would make per trip, hoping to be able to pay extra
to get him to go to Mar Telos first. The elf cuts in, refusing to
divert the course, whereas the Captain insists they will gladly divert
for 100 gold.

As for passage on the ship, the captain says he will take 25 gold
each, but will gladly refund it at the end of the journey if they make
themselves useful. Inorem is enraged at this, insisting that they are
still passengers and should have to pay full price, regardless of how
they spend their time. The Captain gladly welcomes each upon their
acceptance of the offer, happily contradicting whatever comment First
Mate Inorem makes regarding their uselessness as crew.

A sailor with an air of authority walks, by giving a tour to the other
passengers. Meanwhile the other sailors are hard at work loading the
ship with more cargo. The party all begins to help with the loading as
Enoch goes below decks to pray for a safe journey. With the weight of
the new cargo, the ship gradually sinks lower and lower into the
water.

As the ship becomes ready to sail, a man comes running towards the
ship, yelling for it to wait, wearing only his underwear, his clothing
and sword held over his head. Behind him runs the half-orc blacksmith,
who's daughter is waving from the inn window, a sheet clutched to her
breast. As the man boards the ship the gang plank is raised leaving
the furious smith standing at the docks glaring.

> This was the introduction of Eric's new character. He and I had

## Session 1, Part 2

As soon as all are settled the ship sets sail. Eventually they make
their way to the mess deck. An unshaven sailor wanders over to their
table and joins them. Skeeve greets him as he sits, which is more than
enough to loosen the sailor's tongue. A man who enjoys his own voice,
Nobert introduces himself as a member of the crew and cheerfully goes
on to fill them in on all the ins and outs of the crew, wandering
happily from subject to subject with little prompting from the party.

![The Ocean's Majesty](images/ship1.gif)

As it turns out, Endo was right in assuming that boxes coming from the
blacksmith were likely war supplies. The ship is selling weapons to
the northern states of Mar Tesaro, an island deep in some sort of
civil war.

The conversation then turns to Inorem, whom according to Nobert, the
crew dislikes. His rudeness and distaste for humans are more than
enough to keep him from favor amongst the crew. Inorem used to sail on
a much grander elven ship, but it was sunk in the battle of Bayhaven.
He'd been forced to take this position on a human crew and he resents
it. Half of the cargo hold is his, and he is free to use this ship
until he can make enough to buy his own. He does this by stacking it
to the rafters with weapons for sale at Mar Tesoro.

Nobert then goes on to explain that Beck used to be first mate, losing
the title to Inorem when the Captain offered to help Inorem get funds
for a new ship. The crew however misses Beck as such, liking him as
much as they hate Inorem. The crew also is very fond of the captain,
who they refer to as "Puffins" or "Puff". He runs a loose ship, but
his generosity with his pay make up for any faults.

Nobert rambles on about various things until he settles on his girl
Talla in Bayhaven, and he how is looking forward to seeing her. He
goes on to describe her many attributes, though none of them seem to
be her looks. After some time the men manage to turn his conversation
to Bayhaven. Bayhaven is fine, or was when the ship was last there.
The old town has been repaired and there was a huge harvest that year
up north. Their biggest problem is that goods are piling up on the
docks because there aren't enough ships to move everything. Several
were lost in the battle of Bayhaven, and a few others to pirates
before that. Other ships are floating goods for the war (which is more
profitable) so Bayhaven just isn't getting enough ships to move
everything.

Nobert takes leave when he finishes eating, saying he is needed on
deck. The others go to work for a bit then retire to their quarters
for the night.

### 23rd of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day is clear and bright. Around noon the party, all about
their duties, hear a ruckus on the deck. There they see a big crowd
gathered, a great conglomeration of sweaty sailors and noise. After
some shoving the party manages to work their way towards the innards
of the fray, only to find Beck and Nobert in the middle, preparing to
fight. The party finally surmises that Nobert and Beck had each had a
letter from their girl back home, only to find that she was one and
the same AND pregnant. After further discussion the two decide to
fight for her. The winner of the fight will get to stay a sailor,
loser will get all the money and go back to Bayhaven to marry Talla.

Inorem quickly steps in trying to settle it, pointing out that "This
is most certainly not how civilized people settle arguments and
certainly not on my.. erm.. this ship."

The captain however waves him aside with a brisk, "Go ahead, go ahead,
lets see the outcome. This should be a good show."

Both men quickly throw down their valuables in a pile as the mob of
sailors crowds Inorem out of the way. It is no contest. Beck easily
wins the fight, knocking Nobert out cold in less than a minute. Beck
looks through his pockets, making sure he didn't miss anything of
value to give to Nobert. He goes below, looking sad.

Someone dumps a bucket of sea water over Nobert, who despite the
numerous cuts, bruises, and one rather large lump upon the head, wakes
immediately, grins a wide, toothy grin, and shouts, "Congratulate me
boys, I'm getting married!" The crew all cheers.

### 24th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day arises, sleepy and full of sun. The seas sits calmly,
gently rocking the old boat. The party assembles over their evening
meal when they are approached by the man they had seen running from
the smith. He introduces himself as Thu'fir, settles himself down
amongst them and begins to talk. He likes to talk, mainly about
himself and his pet sword. He goes on and on about the number of
people he had killed with it, though when questioned they find that
the number is rather smaller than his bragging implies (namely 11).

### 25th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day is rainy, a steady chill drizzle, in which the crew works
steadily in alternating wind and rain.

Enoch, in his rambling about the ship (being a cleric, the crew will
not let him help), discovers that there is another cleric aboard and
decides to visit him the next day. The crew warns him that the other
cleric is a bit of a joke, quite old, blind, and deaf.

Enoch makes his way below decks to the infirmary. There he finds
Crolman, a human who looks to be a hundred years old and his
attendant, a young sailor who tries continually to make sense of the
old man's mumblings, hoping for a hint at what the weather will be in
the coming days. After some time and a bit of halting conversation
with the sailor Enoch surmises that Crolman had once been a cleric but
has now lost all his powers except for a gift of prophecizing the
weather, which Crolman foretells in fits and starts amidst numerous
comments on food and achy joints. While Enoch listenes, Crolman
suggests that he is hungry, thirsty, uncomfortable, and that the
weather will be fine for the next two days.

While Enoch visits the old cleric, Thordek looks for Beck. He finds
him in the carpentry shop of the ship, practicing his sword fighting.
Thordek watches as Beck's sword slices through the air, looking as if
it was drawing an elaborate picture inthe air as it flashes and
swirles, cutting and slicing.

Skeeve decides to go practice his flying.

### 26th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day there is much talk amongst the sailors about Crolman as
he seems to be very disturbed and more confused and upset than usual.
Each has his own opinion about Crolman's odd sayings that day. Enoch
goes below deck to see what is going on.

In the infirmary he finds Crolman and his helper, Crolman going on,
mostly about food but quite happily tossing in random, cryptic
comments regarding the weather, and in all appearances quite
disturbed. The sailor attending him is listening carefully to each
word he says, attempting to get a straightforward answer out of him,
so intently that he rather absentmidedly gets his food and drink and
sets them down before him. Crolman, in his own little world, is quite
oblivious to him. Crolman sits in his usual spot feeling around on the
table before him obviously looking for his food, "Hungry!? â€¦Thirsty?!"

Crolman mumbles, "They won't like us. Not gonna be happy. Not our
friends."

"Hungry!?" Crolman exclaimes as he feels around for his food. "Gonna
rain. Big storm. The ocean's gonna fall on our heads. Two days off, "
Crolman continues, still feeling around for his food, " Watch the
sail. Tie it fast. Don't let it come loose!"

"Wet!" Crolman complains as he finds his food having put his hand in
it as he felt for it.

Enoch then goes back on deck to tell the others about the latest, more
complete news on the coming storm.

### 27th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next morning the captain announces that they are drawing close to
Fort Bolland, and should reach it by morning. There is a storm
approaching, but they expect to reach shore well before it hit. The
men need to work fast to secure the ship and get it unloaded before
the storm hit. They need to get some of the dead weight (weapons) out
of the hold so they will be less likely to sink with the high waves.
Everyone needs to pitch in to make sure they are ready when the storm
hit, or the ship risks being smashed into the docks.

The standing rule is no shore leave in Fort Bolland, due to the war.
This is still the case, but the captain allows some of the crew to go
ashore and seek lodgings, since there is no sense in sleeping on a
ship in a storm at port. He asks for volunteers to stay up all night
and watch over the ship.

At dawn they make ready to port.

An hour later the island draws near. The storm is a ways off yet.
Everyone relaxes. It looks like they will port and unload well ahead
of the storm. As they approach, the sailor in the crow's nest sounds
an alarm. They draw closer and see that the city is laid to waste. All
has been burned. The lighthouse is dark, and the docks are smoking. A
lone and crudely built watchtower had been built on the coast with a
sign of an eye with a thorn through it.

![This is the image on the flag seen flying over the city.](images/flag.gif)


Fort Bolland has been defeated.

## Session 1, Part 3

The captain concludes the south has conquered the town. Their only
hope is to sail around the north end of the island and head for the
city of Breakshore. If the city still stands they may buy the weapons
in the hold, or at least allow port and re-supply.

Inorem reminds him of the storm.

The captain replies that now the storm will work in their favor. Ships
of the south may well pursue them if not for the bad weather.

They bring the ship about and make for the north. As they turned they
see and hear the alarm being raised from the tower on shore. They can
see men scurrying about on the shore, archers obviously standing to
the ready should they come within range.

The captain orders that all the cargo be dumped overboard. They are
too low in the water and too slow to have any hope of reaching
Breakshore like this. Inorem protests. The Captain relents. The crew
is ordered to empty only the Captains' share of the cargo.

Beck meets the loaders in the cargo hold and suggests they
"accidentally" dump some of Inorem's stuff as well, since his stuff is
towards the front and they will have to climb over and around it to
get to the captain's.

Hours pass. The ship rises out of the water as it gets lighter. The
men are sweating and exhausted as they work steadily trying to get
ahead of the oncoming storm.

Inorem is furious about the cargo being thrown over. Skeeve tries to
calm him down. Inorem assumes it was the humans and dwarf who did it,
though Skeeve helped with quite a bit.

The ship pushes west at a good clip.

A whistle blows, sounding general quarters. The party comes up on deck
to see the sky a sick green. The air is still and quiet. The men look
apprehensive. It is very warm and humid. The ship stops moving as
there is no longer any wind.

The captain orders the men to secure the sails, and the officers and
the party are called to the navigation room.

The captain explains the basics of weather navigation, heading into
the wind, not worrying about where you're going, just ride up one side
of a wave and down the other, no sails, as the wind will push the ship
over, OR the mast will snap like a twig.

The storm draws nearer. The temperature drops quickly. Suddenly it is
wet and chilly. The sea begins to churn.

The sky grows black as the sun sets. Rain begins to fall. As the ship
is buffeted by the storm, they begin to take on water. The ship is
still riding low in the ocean. The captain sits by the wheel upon his
barrel. Two stout men, Thordek and Thu'fir are sent to the wheel. The
captain explains that the more they aim INTO the wind, the safer they
are. The sails are tied up and everyone else is sent below.

Skeeve begins offering random spells he can do. None of them are "make
the storm go away", so the captain sends him belowdecks with the rest.
Thordek and Thu'fir have no trouble keeping the ship on course.

Night falls. Inorem stands just inside the door and runs the damage
control operation. At first he sets the men to bilge, but it is a lost
cause. Water comes in too fast. He concludes they need to lift the
ship up or they'll sink. He orders all hands to begin hauling his
weapons up from the hold, and shoving them out the door. He goes out
and sets to pushing the crates overboard.

Beck is there to remind the party that they could have tossed Inorem's
stuff hours ago, made better time, and saved themselves a lot of
trouble during the storm. Inorem's greed has put them in greater
danger.

Sailors (along with Eomer) work furiously to haul the heavy cargo out
of the hold and get it overboard. Then, one of them loses his footing
on the slick steps. The crate hits the deck and burst open, releasing
an avalanche of broadswords down the steps. The hapless sailor is
caught in the flow and sliced up as he falls downstairs in the pile of
weapons. Eomer is right behind him, but quick enough to leap up and
place his feet on the railings, holding himself above the steps as the
swords and victim slid by beneath him.

> As a Rogue, Eomer's reflex saving throws are through the roof, so he
> always gets to make cool saves like this.

The steps are now coated with seawater, blood, and swords. Enoch is
called. He grants healing to the injured man, while everyone else goes
about the tricky job of gathering up the swords as they slide back and
fourth on the rocking deck. The cargo unloading operation is delayed
as all of this happens.

## Session 1, Part 4

Above deck there is a horrific crack as the mainsail rips free,
unfurls and catches the wind. The loose ropes whip about violently in
the wind. Beck is sent out with Eomer to secure the sail (if they can)
or cut it loose (if they have to) lest the mast be broken.

Eomer and Beck struggle to secure the sail. They have to climb the
rope netting and recover the sail. Eomer is blown off as he reaches
and misses. He falls into a wet coil of ropes on the deck.

> Although, even the most nimble of characters can still have a bad
> roll once (or twice) in a whileâ€¦.

Eomer is still conscious after the fall but is hurt. He gets back to
his feet and attempts to climb back up. He climbs back up but nearly
falls off again, managing only to catch hold. The mast creaks loudly.
The ship is listing heavily as the wind shoves the vessel around. Not
wanting to waste any more time, Eomer and Beck draw their swords and
cut the sail free.

They climb down and get belowdecks again. Inorem stands by, furious
that the sail has been cut.

A wave wash over the ship. Thordek losses his grip and is knocked over
while sliding across the deck, getting caught in the the ropes.
Thu'fir holds on to the wheel.

When all recover, they see that the captain is gone.

| Beck yells, " Bring us about, we must rescue him!" over the wind.
| Inorem shouts, " Belay that! Hold your course!"
| Beck, "We can't leave the captain!"
| Inorem, "I'm in charge!"
| Beck, "You won't take his ship!"
| Inorem, "Going back is suicide!"
| Beck, "Leaving him is suicidal for you!"

They draw their swords and start to fight as they fall down to the
quarterdeck. With them gone, Thordek, Thu'fir, and Eomer are free to
choose who they will obey. Should they abandon the captain, or risk
the entire ship by trying to come about? Cutting accross the wind will
be very dangrous.

> Yes, Eomer is mysteriously on deck again, even though he went in.
> This is one of those moments where the DM lost track and slipped up.
> I guess he came back outside for some reason?

They choose to go back for the captain and begin trying to turn about.
As the ship turns accross the wind, they loose control of the wheel
and the ship turns sideways. Eomer and Thu'fir try to regain course.
Waves wash over the deck. Thordek looses his footing and slides away,
ramming into the railing.

A flash of lightning reveals the two combatants on the Forecastle
Deck. Beck has run Irnoem through. He pushes the elf off of his sword
and into the sea.

Thordek grabs the banister and tries to work his way down to the
quarterdeck.

The ship starts to list. A wave comes across the deck and the ship
begins to lean to starboard. Water pours over the deck. One of the
hatches dips below the water for a moment and the ship takes a big
drink. The wave relents and the ship corrects itself. Those at the
wheel find it is much easier to steer but nothing happens when they
do.

Beck shouts above the din, "The storm has pushed us too far south.
We're being drawn into Stonehelm!"

Lightning flashes, and they can see the dark rocky teeth of Stonehelm
jutting out of the water. There is nothing they can do. The ship is
beyond their control, and all they can do is wait to be dashed against
the rocks.

The rocks are hidden for a moment as they are engulfed by waves. A
moment later the wave passes and the rocks are even closer. There is
an overpowering crash as the ship is torn apart.

All manage to keep their weapons and armor, but are obliged to leave
their packs behind. Thordek and Thu'fir, dressed in scale mail, were
sure to sink unless they gave up their armor. Thordek suggests they
lock arms over the captain's barrel. They do so, and jump in, using
the barrel as a raft. Skeeve uses his arcane magic and takes to the
air. He lights his staff and provides light over a rock jutting from
the water. He acts as a beacon to the others. Enoch calls on his holy
powers and walks on water with Eomer and 3 other of the crew he grabs.
Together they head toward the rock where Skeeve hovers.

The ship slides beneath the waves, and they are left among the
churning waves. Everyone ends up at the rock, clinging to it. They
have no food, no water, no way to rest, and no idea which way land is.
Enoch passes out from exposure. Those that survive are exhausted,
hungry, and thirsty, barely holding on in the midst of the storm.

As the night draws on, the storm relents.

### 28th of Suncrest, 1501dy

Dawn comes at last to show that most of the crew has drowned. Many
bodies are face-down in the shipwreck-filled water about them. As the
sky brightens, they can see the island to the south, less than a mile
away. Of those Enoch saved, there are only two sailors left. Thordek
and Thu'fir are kicking their way toward shore. Enoch helps the others
get to shore walking on water.

Thordek and Thu'fir get to shore and are waiting for the rest. Bits of
the ship litter the beach.

Endo is gone.

Way down the beach they find Beck digging a hole with a part of a
stool as a shovel, making a grave. Nobert is dead, and Beck wants to
bury him. He finishes the shallow grave and puts Nobert in. After a
moment of silence, Beck resolves to travel with the party back to
Bayhaven and marry Talla.

It is drizzling and cold. Everyone is exhausted and has been without
food and fresh water for about 10 hours. Nobody has slept in over 24
hours.

Eomer goes off looking for Endo. Enoch casts helping hand (a mystical
floating hand that searches a 5 mile radius) The magical hand drifts
away in search of Endo.

Thu'fir and Eomer search for roots etc to eat in the woods. Beck gives
them the gist of the island by drawing in the sand (what he has seen
on a map.) Obviously they are near Stonehelm and the river. They are
not sure however, if the Alidians have taken Breakshore and decide to
try to avoid them. Skeeve levitates and finds the river Â¾ of a mile
west. Everyone heads to the river except Enoch who decides to stay at
the beach in case Endo comes. The dwarf rinses off in the river.
Thu'fir cleans up as well.

After some time, the hand returns without Endo, and then disappears.

Enoch rests on the beach with the two who were saved while waiting for
the others to return. Everyone else rests by the river. Thordek offers
the use of his helmet to carry water back to Enoch. Beck washes it out
and fills it. They walk slowly and carefully back to Enoch. Enoch
drinks, sharing with the other two who decide to rest a bit before
moving on.

After a rest, they head for the road, which should be somewhere south.

Thu'fir goes first, then Eomer, Enoch, Beck, Skeeve, then Thordek.

The party encounters a group of soldiers coming from the underbrush
ahead of them. They are scratched up and covered in leaves from
running through the brush. Immediately the soldiers begin to question
them. There are three soldiers and one unarmed soldier.

They conclude the party is a group of mercenaries come to help the
northerners, and attempt to arrest them.

The party refuses to surrender their weapons. The uniformed unarmed
man speaks in the ear of the head soldier and the group spreads out.

The party see this is leading to combat and act first. Skeeve summons
a flaming sphere, rolling it toward one of the soldiers. The
underbrush catches fire in its wake. Weapons are drawn.

The unarmed soldier stands behind the others, casting magic at the
party. It is a hard battle. Both Enoch and Skeeve had spent much of
their magic in the night before, and had not had time to refresh
themselves.

One by one the soldiers fell. Skeeve and the other wizard end up in a
sort of duel, tossing fire magic at one another. Finally the opposing
wizard backs into the underbrush for cover. Skeeve commanded a flaming
sphere to travel around him in a tight circle, setting the brush on
fire. Thus surrounded, the sphere rolls onto the wizard and he
perished in flames.

As the last soldier fell, Eomer cries out, "Isn't anyone everglad to
see us?!?!?!"

The party retreats for a few minutes, as the fire spreads. Eventually
it burns itself out on the soaked vegitation and leaves a smouldering
hole in the woods. The smell of burning skin and hair surrounds them.
The party scavenges for usable items amongst the dead.

## Session 1, Part 5

Beck points out that these soldiers were without supplies, so
therefore they must have had a base or camp nearby. Eomer changes into
the guard's uniform he scavenged from the least damaged soldier,
disguising himself as one of the guards, telling his party to stay
about 200 hundred yards from him. He follows the way the soldiers had
come and finds a clearing with the remains of a fire and camp. While
searching the area Eomer finds a cut length of rope, the cloth
wrappings from iron rations, a dead soldier, obviously the captain of
the band they saw, who was wearing a scale mail and has a horn. His
neck has been snapped.

Eomer calls the rest of the party and they join him. Thordek searches
and finds four backpacks with bed rolls and three iron rations. He
also finds Endo's staff.

Eomer is concerned at this. He knows Endo would not have left this
behind on purpose. He searches as well, and using his knowledge of the
wild he determines that a horse had been tied here, then was ridden
east, towards Breakshore. Other horses were here and have gone west.
Skeeve, Thu'fir, and Beck each take a backpack. The party stays to
rest. Thu'fir starts a fire and the rest go to sleep. Thu'fir heads
about 100 yards toward the conquered town (west) to watch for any more
activity.

### 1st of Last Summer, 1501dy

At 1 am the party sets out on the road. They follow it to Breakshore.

![The village of Breakshore](images/breakshore.gif)

The city is a medium-sized village along the coast. There are no ships
in the port, which means they will not be escaping the isand soon.

Enoch and Skeeve go into town and head for the church. The church is
overflowing with books. They speak to the head priest who explains the
situation to them.

The Alidians (the southern forces) took the town without much
resistance about a fortnight ago. They took the mayor away, but left
everyone else alone. They commandeered a few farmhouses, took a goodly
supply of food, all of the horses, and slew a few men who resisted,
but they departed after a week and headed in the direction of Fort
Bolland. The lands here in the north are still under martial law, and
nobody is permitted to travel in the north without official papers.
Anyone found in the wilderness will be assumed to be part of the
resistance (of which there was very, very little) and arrested. The
priest suggests they might be able to travel to Crossway and appeal to
the local governor for papers if they explain their situation. They
might also be able to buy forged papers.

He also tells them he has seen Endo and that he had quickly left town
with a friend.

The rest of the party goes to the inn while Eomer goes to the priest
and tries get an explanation of whom Endo was traveling with.

The rest of the party goes to the tavern / inn. The bartender welcomes
them and says that meals were free for Alidian soldiers. Thu'fir
claims to be a soldier for a free meal.

He is quickly found out when the bartender checks with the priest.

The bartender offers to help. He explains that there were supplies
hidden in the smith's house but that the house had been taken over by
the soldiers.

## Mar Talos

Mar Talos is home to the Elves. Other races are not allowed to roam
the land, and must remain in the capital / port city of Talosport. It
is also the home of Sagemaster Teerin Forwinol.

Sagemaster was a major figure in our first campaign. He's over 400
years old. He is respected and known throughout the other islands and
Dunlock. He's wise, thoughtful, and slow to act on anything. He
prefers to watch and let things play out instead of getting involved,
even when he has the power to intervene. He loves peace, and gets
along well with other races.

Mar Talos has benefitted over the last 100 years with him as the
leader. The island is strong, prosperous and secure.
