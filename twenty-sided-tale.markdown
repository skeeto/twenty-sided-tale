% Twenty Sided Tale
% Shamus Young; Heather Young

This is a running narrative of our Dungeons & Dragons campaign. This
is a custom campaign written by me, using the 3.5 edition rules. Our
group meets at my house Sunday evenings and usually plays for about 5
hours. I run the session while my wife transcribes events as they
unfold. After the session I go over our notes (both her live notes and
my pre-game notes) and turn them into the story you read here.

This means that what you read is a collaboration between myself and
six other people. I design the plot and enforce the rules, but the
five players decide how the heroes deal with (or avoid) the challenges
they encounter. Finally, the chaos is turned into what is hopefully an
interesting narrative.

This is our third campaign together. The other two campaigns are not
on-line, although if there is some demand I may post them. All of the
characters are currently level 5 at the start of this campaign. The
current active players are Skeeve the Wizard, Eomer the Rogue, Thordek
the Fighter, Thu'fir the Blade Lord, and Enoch the Cleric.

The campaigns I run are usually a bit more low-key and realistic than
your average D&D story. So, likely as not you'll see Orcs, Goblins,
and Zombies, but I doubt we'll have stuff like gelatenous cubes,
mimics, or dimensional grabbers. Towns are filled with commoners, not
extraplaner travelers. You won't see any talking swords in my world,
and dragons are very, very rare. True magic users are about as rare as
celebreties or pro atheletes in our world. Commoners are aware of
magic and deal with it from time to time, but they don't see it every
day. This is just a style thing. I find the world easier to visualize
if it looks a bit more like our world. I have a hard time imagining
how warfare and commerce would work if a good portion of the populace
could teleport or fly around on pet hippographs. This rule change is
the sort of thing I'm talking about.

I'm writing this campaign because I'd like to see other people doing
this sort of thing. Perhaps it will catch on? I'd love to read the
campaigns other people come up with. If you blog a campaign like this,
please email me and let me know. I'd love to read what you have, and
I'd be glad to add you to the links.

## Mar Tesaro

Mar Tesoro is the setting of our current campaign. It is a large
island (It would take a little better than a week to walk from the
north shore to the south) that is inhabited by two seperate groups:
The Northerners (also called "Lormanites"), and the Alidians.

![](images/map_mar_tesaro.gif)

On the south side of the island is a mountain called "Mount Khelberg".
It is apparently a very large and valuable mountain that contains a
lot of precious metals and gems. From what the party has gathered, the
war seems to be over who should control the mountain.

## Introduction

The characters are in the town of Golgotha. It is late in the month of
Suncrest (July). They just helped the city fend off an army of undead,
saved everyone, and became the big heroes, thus ending the last
campaign. The battle ended three days ago and they have been resting
since then. The battle destroyed and burned down a good bit of the
town, which is now being rebuilt.

The current party is Skeeve the Wizard, Eomer the Rogue, Thordek the
Fighter, and Enoch the Cleric. Lucian the ranger is still part of the
group, but that character is being retired (replaced) with another one
in the first session.

## Endo

![](images/pc_endo.jpg)

| Name: Endo
| Race: Human
| Class: Monk
| Played By: Shamus (Endo is an NPC when I'm the DM)

Endo is a follower of the Ki-Tan fighting style. He lived in Highstone
Monastery, a large stone structure overlooking the town of Bridgehold
in Grey Moor. The town and the monastery formed a sort of symbiotic
relationship. The Monks guarded the town (so traditional town guards
were not needed) while the townies provided food and clothing for the
monks.

Over a few generations various misunderstandings led to quite a bit of
animosity between the two, and eventually they came to resent each
other. The story is too long to relate here, but the short of it is
that at the time of our story it was the custom for select monks to
become "guardians" of the town. As part of their guardianship, they
take a vow of silence and also a vow never to strike (or even
threaten) a resident of the town. After seven years, their
guardianship would end (along with their vows of silence and pacifisim
toward the members of the town) and it was more or less expected that
they would leave the monastery to seek their fortune elsewhere, or
stay and become teachers.

Young men of the city would often take advantage of this vow and taunt
or torment the very guardians that kept them safe from external
threats. (A bit like the way people picked on the Amish in "Witness")
Different monks came up with various ways of dealing with this. One
simply ran when accosted by surly young men in town. Another avoided
coming into town during the day, and instead ran his errands at night.
He would sneak into shops, procure what he needed, and leave the money
on the counter.

Endo had a different way of dealing with it. He stood there and took
it. He would stand still and endure their slaps, insults and spit
until they grew bored and left. Eventually the bullies (there were two
young men who did this) grew angry that they couldn't daunt the monk.
They became more abusive, eventually punching and kicking Endo in an
attempt to get SOME response out of him. Endo never made any attempt
to resist them. They would pummel him until they were exhausted. For
years Endo was covered in cuts and bruises.

As his guardianship drew to a close, the player characters came into
town on their quest. Enoch the cleric encountered Endo on the road and
offered him healing, which Endo silently refused.

There was a counsil at the monastery about the problems that players
faced, and the curse on the land. During the counsil, Endo was
released from his seven-year vow and a new guardian was sworn in. Endo
spoke for the first time in seven years (his voice is very raspy) to
thank his teacher, and then left without hearing the rest of the
proceedings. The meeting was long (lots of talk between the players
and the leaders of the city / monastery) and a lot of the plot was
filled in. Towards the end of the meeting, Endo came in and sat down
without saying a word.

As everyone rose to leave, a couple of townies barged in, breathless,
shouting that Endo had just walked into town and murdered two men.

This was Endo's solution to the bullies in town. He fulfilled his
oath, and the moment it was over he went and snapped the neck and back
of his tormentors. He did NOT do this out of revenge, but out of a
desire to end the violence against guardians. From now on if someone
abused a guardian, he need only stand still and accept it. His passive
attitude would carry a very real implied threat: In seven years I will
kill you.

From that point on, the abuse of guardians ended forever.

In the meantime, there were a lot of sore feelings in town about what
Endo had done. It was decided that he should leave town and travel
with the party as a guide through the mountains.

## Eomer

![](images/pc_eomer.jpg)

| Name: Eomer
| Race: Human
| Class: Rogue
| Played By: Pat

Eomier Abrin DeCauste was born to a soldier, Claudius. While he was
not afforded luxury, he was not deprived either. By means of his
father he was taught at the only established school on the island,
which in those times was almost always a church, and this school was
no different.

He was often told not only by his father, but at the school, of the
crusades of Ubrin Lorich. Three generations had passed since Ubrin and
his companions freed the isle of Grey Moor from its natural occupants;
the orcs. These stories were grand, elaborate and verbose. I will not
burden your ear with the stories in full Elvish song, but know that to
the children of Greymoor these songs were as intoxicating as fine
wine. Idolization of Ubrin and his friends was assured.

"Ubrin had, with the aid of his friends, hunted down and killed every
tribe of orc on the island. Afterwards he declared Grey Moor a free
island, that no man should ever rule it. None but those who sought to
take from others should be turned away from its shores. Like everyone
else, Eomier was astounded that one could be so selfless as to give up
an entire island after conquering it almost single handedly. While
many stories circulated as to why Ubrin had such an acute distaste for
monarchies or established governments, none were ever proven, and no
one really thought it that important.

After Ubrin parted ways with his companions, he constructed the office
of the protector of Grey Moor. He did little but watch the city of
Bayhaven grow around him till his death, save slaying the occasional
band of goblins. He sired and raised a son, Aaron, and instructed him
in the way of the sword and the way of the pen. After his death Aaron
took over stewardship of the island, keeping to his fathers will that
no man should have dominion over another. Aaron lived many years and
saw Bayhaven grow from fledgling town to a city that drew trade ships.
It was during this time that so many races came to settle in Grey
Moor. Despite the usual tensions that exist whenever dwarf, human and
Halfling live in such close proximity, Greymoor and its (lack of)
politics kept these disagreements to a minimum.

It is during Aaron's tenure that the first mention of the Monks of the
Highstone Monastery is made, a passive (but lethal) order of Monks
that had taken stewardship of the local town of Bridgehold. It's not
clear if the town or monastery came first, but since the monks had a
penchant for vows of silence, no one really knows for sure.

No one knows how long the dwarves had been on the island, but it was
also around this time that their presence was discovered.
All-the-while this seemingly uninhabited island was home to a clan of
Dwarven stone masters. Like most dwarves they were very content to
live within their mountain, unburdened with anything outside of it.
Little was heard from the dwarves, but Aaron did arrange a reasonable
trade of goods and foods (mostly ale and textiles) from off-island for
whatever valuables the dwarves were willing to part with.

Aaron knew that once word of trade with Dwarven miners spread that the
trade ships would be more eager to stop at this once small port.
Peoples from all over Mar Talos soon came to find their fortunes in
the mountains that cut the island in half, find adventure in the
north, to free themselves from oppression or to simply claim a strip
of land and make a simple living.

During his time as steward Aaron saw Grey Moor's population grow from
a few hundred to almost ten thousand, with roughly 4 thousand in
Bayhaven alone. This did, however, cost him quite dearly. He invested
much of his families' fortune out of a sense of obligation to his
charge as Protector. Near the end of his wildly successful and
peaceful tenure, he made one error that would eventually engulf the
island in civil war: He levied a tax on ships stopping in port, simply
for upkeep of the docks themselves. While this is customary in all
other ports, this was the first time that such a thing had been done
on Greymoor. Without knowledge or intent, Aaron created a government.
The office of the protector passed to his son, Reginald."

During childhood the fact did not escape Eomier that while there were
more than a few thousand families in Bayhaven, there were less than a
hundred students. This troubled him greatly, and he sought answers.
The head master (and head priest as it was) Tenril at first seemed
annoyed that a boy would question such things, and took it as an
accusation. He rebuked Eomier, and his father was less than pleased.
For 7 years he kept his silence.

By age 11 he was the top student, and his father had advanced to rank
of Lieutenant and personal advisor to Reginald the Protector. One day,
while walking home from school, as he passed the keep he saw his
father and his men taking a young man, not many years older than
Eomier, up to the keep. He looked like he had been roughed up quite a
bit, and the number of guards escorting him suggested whatever his
offense had been, this was a very dangerous man. Eomier asked his
father what the man had done. The man had been caught stealing, and
his punishment would be imprisonment for 2 years, or banishment to the
north. This was basically a death sentence, since no one had come back
from the north in 20 years. He was told of how there would ALWAYS be
people who will take advantage of others if not kept at bay. And that
is what the office of the protector, and in turn Eomier's father, did.
There were always thieves who would pray on the innocent if not dealt
with, and dealt with harshly. This is what Ubrin did, and what he had
envisioned for Grey Moor. Eomier accepted this.

Days later while again walking home from school Eomier was accosted by
several older boys. He did not recognize them and they were much
bigger than him. He did what most boys would do, he ran. Fleeing
through the streets he turned a corner, ducked into a shop and
vanished from his pursuers. As his breath returned, peering out the
window as his attackers passed by, he was startled from a gruff voice
from behind:

"Get used to it kid..."

He turned around to see a man not as old as his voice would make him
seem. He stood there, frozen, scared and out of breath.

"You don't even know why they're chasing you, do you?"

Eomier shook his head, he had no idea. Eldon informed him that his
father had become quite well known as Reginald's lap dog, making more
than a few enemies. It was the first time he first heard the other
side life on Grey Moor, away from the keep and the school. He heard of
how a few days earlier a man had been imprisoned for trying to sneak a
few things off a ship without paying the tariff first. He had always
paid before; he simply needed to sell the goods first to pay the tax.
Instead he was beaten, jailed, and his goods claimed. The story of an
entire ships crew banished to the North for a mere casket of wine.
Eomier refused to believe it, and left the shop and ran home.

By age 14 he was done with school, and it was time to do what was
expected of him and follow in his fathers footsteps. His first
assignments were simply escorting goods from the port south to the
towns north. He did this often for several months, and it wore on him.
He wished to keep the peace, to defend the people of Grey Moor.

While daydreaming of riding with Ubrin one day, three men jumped from
the bushes along the road and snatched several bags of grain from a
cart right in front of him. Surprised because he wasn't paying
attention, but mostly because these three men hardly looked like the
viscous thieves he was trained to look out for. They were dirty,
ragged, and very obviously starving. They didn't look anything like
the thieves or evil-doers he had imagined, they were starving
peasants. Two of them weren't even wearing shoes. As he watched them
"flee", still quite surprised at their appearance, he watched as all
three were chased down and cut to pieces by other guards on horseback.
Shocked at what had just happened, he said nothing as the Captain
rebuked him for not paying attention. When he returned home, he asked
his father of what had happened, and of his thoughts. Again his father
to reprimanded him for questioning the way of things, and told him to
be more thoughtful of his duty. Troubled by what had happened, he
sought advice from an unlikely source: The shopkeeper.

Eldon was all too eager to fill his ears with stories such as the one
he had seen. And soon Eomier was starting to question exactly who was
oppressing who? Who was the thief? Was he really defending the people?
He struggled with his own ideals and began to see not just the world
he had been shown, but what was hidden behind strong doors and clean
clothes. He used his fathers influence and status (which was now
Magistrate) to look into some of the accusations levied against the
prisoners of the keep. He was shocked to find out that jails were
full, usually for the smallest of offenses, but almost always having
to do with monies owed to the office of the protector. Crimes against
other citizens were dealt with in the harshest manor possible. There
were no rights, no appeals, only the decree of the Protector.

Secretly he began to funnel info to his new friend, Eldon. In turn he
was taught useful skills, and mostly he felt he was only now really
helping people who needed it.

He was still young however, and was soon caught. After a very heated
argument with his father, he left the Office of the Protector and
found work smuggling goods from the north to escape what was now a
ridiculous tax. With every trip back to Bayhaven, a new wing had been
added to the keep. It resembled a castle more than anything, and the
flags of "The Office of the Protector" flew as a King's would.
Eomier's contempt grew every trip.

## Lucian

![](images/pc_lucian.jpg)

| Name: Lucian
| Race: Elf
| Class: Ranger
| Played By: Eric

Lucian has an interesting backstory about betrayal within his family
which sent him into exile (and thus adventuring) but it hasn't really
been introduced in-game.

This character was retired at the end of our second campaign, and Eric
rolled up a new character.

## Skeeve

![](images/pc_skeeve.jpg)

| Name: Skeeve
| Race: Elf
| Class: Wizard
| Played By: Dan

Skeeve is an unusual Wizard. While everyone else had more or less
serious, Tolkien-esque names, Dan gave his Wizard a more comedic name.
Skeeve is also a rustic "farmboy" among Elves, and self-taught himself
magic instead of being an apprentice or joining a guild.

Dan is also pretty outspoken, impulsive, and foul-mouthed. He tends to
blurt out outragous things, to which I reply, "Did you say that in
character?" He'll often reply, "Um. Sure."

So what we ended up with was a very brash Wizard with a penchant for
shooting off his mouth and dropping the F-bomb.

## Yoeg

![](images/pc_yoeg.jpg)

| Name: Yoeg
| Race: Half-Orc
| Class: Barbarian
| Played By: Joe (Retired)

Yoeg's father Keroning (a full orc, and an outcast among his people)
rescued Yoeg's human mother from bandits (possibly rapists). They
lived in the hills in secret and had a son. Some humans found out
about the grotesque union and attacked the house. They slew his father
and mother, and entered the house to find an empty cradle.

Years later (during our first campaign) a Paladin came to Grey Moor,
looking for the Half-Orc. The paladin was large, well-armed, and had
several stout people in his party. Fearing him, the party fled north.

He finally caught up with the party in the town of stackroot. The
paladin revealed that his father was one of the people who attacked
Yoeg's house and killed his parents. Keroning had killed his father,
and the paladin was here to dispense justice and rid the world of the
Orc's vile offspring. He was here to finish the job his father
started.

He promised an honorable fight: If Yoeg would fight him one-on-one,
none of his friends (the other players) would be harmed. The paladin
produced a massive axe, saying he planned on killing the abomination
(Yoeg) with it's fathers own axe.

The fought, and Yoeg killed the paladin. He then took his father's axe
as his own.

At the end of our first compaign, Yoeg remained in Grey Moor.

## Thordek

![](images/pc_thordek.jpg)

| Name: Thordek Earthguard
| Race: Dwarf
| Class: Fighter
| Played By: Joe

Thordek came from a stout family of miners. He worked as a digger in a
family mine for many decades until he was offered a position as forman
in a distant mine. This was his chance to lead the dig, design the
shafts, and be the first to see the secrets the ground had to offer.
He took the job and travelled a great distance to his new home and dig
site. When he arrived, all were dead. They had been slain weeks
earlier. With no owner and no crew there was no job for him. Thodek
left and began to wander the country, seeking work.

He had a number of adventures before coming to Golgotha in northern
Dunlock.

> Thodek was an NPC in our second campaign. As the campaign drew to a
> close, Joe (the DM) decided he'd rather try a different character,
> as opposed to playing Yoeg again. He wanted to play a Dwarf, so
> using the already-established character Thordek made sense.

## Enoch

![](images/pc_enoch.jpg)

| Name: Enoch
| Race: Human
| Class: Cleric (serves Pelor)
| Played By: Bogan

Bogan wrote a great backstory for this character way back during out
first campaign. Since then I've managed to misplace it. I'll update
this once I find his story. It's somewhere in my DM notes.

Bogan is quiet, and so Enoch ends up being pretty quiet in-game as
well. He's actually one of the most observant characters, and uses his
spells wisely. He's caught me off guard a few times with suddenly
casting a lesser-known (read: non-combat) spell like "zone of truth"
when I wasn't expecting it. As a DM, I always find it rewarding when
players come up with solutions I hadn't thought of.

## The Setting

Before I became DM, the players were in a campaign run by a guy named
Josh, whom I've never met. They parted ways with him and I ended up
running the campaign. Josh was very much a freestyle DM, with no real
shape to the game world. It was just town, woods, town, woods, in some
non-specific country.

When I took over I wanted to keep a bit of continuity, but at the same
time I needed to place them in some sort of structured world. I came
up with the map you see below. I decided that they all came from
"Dunlock", and they were in the coastal town of Djoshport (named after
their hapless former DM). In our first session I stuck them on a boat
for Grey Moor, the site of our first campaign.

![](images/world_map.gif)

Our "world map" consists of the following:

* Dunlock is the main landmass. The players "come from" here. The
  country doesn't really have much in the way of detail, but serves as
  an anchor for the other lands in the game.
* Grey Moor
* Mar Tesaro
* Mar Talos
* The Tunderlands are inhabited, but the players have never been
  there. This land is open for future adventures.

In our first campain the players went to Grey Moor and broke an evil
curse that was killing the crops and draining the land of life, and
then joined in a battle to prevent a single greedy nobleman for
siezing control of the Island. Along the way they teamed up with Eomer
and Endo and attained level 3. The Elves of Mar Talos joined in the
battle to keep the island free. This brought our first campaign to an
end.

At this point one of the players (Joe) became the DM, and I joined the
game as a normal player using Endo. Joe's character stayed on Grey
Moor, and the rest of us sailed to Golgotha in northern Dunlock. The
party battled an army of the undead, saved the land, and made level 5.
I became the DM again, keeping Endo as an NPC that travelled with the
party. The party sailed for Mar Talos, but got shipwrecked on Mar
Tesaro, which our third campaign is now taking place.

## Session 1

### 22nd of Suncrest, 1501dy

The unlikely band of heroes waits impatiently at the inn, for what
they do not know. The town, Golgotha, is swarming with mercenaries but
as heroes the party finds that they do not need to pay for anything.
All they want and more is at their fingertips, yet they itch to be
gone. It has been months since they left Greymoor and some have
unfinished business there awaiting their return.

The inn is nothing more than an abandoned house in view of the docks,
the old inn having been destroyed in the battle three days earlier.
Endo stands in the lobby watching the comings and goings; fighters,
merchants, sailors, thieves, all can be seen walking along the road
near the docks. The docks themselves are a flurry of excitement. A new
ship, rickety and hardly sail worthy, looking to be on its last sails,
is in the dock being stocked full of boxes from the blacksmith shop
down the road.

A young boy runs in the door asking if an Eomer or an Enoch is at the
inn. Endo points toward their rooms. The boy nods and runs off,
disappearing into the depths of the inn.

Moments later the others join Endo in the lobby. Eomer has been given
the following letter:

<div class="document">
Eomer son of Claudius,

We hope you have enjoyed your travels, but the council bids you to
come home and lend aid to our country. We are beset and in need of the
skills of you and your companions. Troubles have come to our land and
we ask that you would remember your obligation to your family and
homeland. Please make haste to the Keep in Bayhaven and we will reveal
what it is you must do.

With Hope,

The Council of Grey Moor
</div>

Enoch also speaks up, saying that he received a letter from Sagemaster:

<div class="document">
To Enoch, Servant of Pelor,

Trusted friend, word may reach your ears of the troubles in Grey Moor.
The Council of Bayhaven has sent word to many allies in search of aid,
and I expect they will contact you as well. I request that you and
your friends come see me in Talosport before visiting the counsil. I
realize this will be an inconvenience to you, and I do not make such a
request lightly. I do promise that what you hear will be to your
advantage. I do not wish to hinder you from acting on events as you
choose, but I would like to advise you before you get involved.

Faithfully,

Sagemaster Teerin Forwinol
</div>

> Grey Moor was the site of their first campaign. They actually set up
> the Council of Grey Moor in the wake of the campaign. Sagemaster
> Teerin is a trusted friend of the PC's and a powerful individual. He
> is the ruler of Mar Talos. (See the map for more details). The party
> is on uneasy terms with the council, but trust Sagemaster a great
> deal.

The party discusses their plans, considering whether to go straight to
Greymoor or to stop at Mar Telos on the way back. Lucian decides to
stay and help the people rebuild their town. Eomer looks sternly at
Lucian and just as sternly says, "Stay away from my girlfriend".

Lucian, known to be a bit of a cad, just grins.

Eomer wanders off to the docks to speak to the boat-masters. After
speaking to several he finds that the only one heading that way is the
Ocean's Majesty, the same decrepit ship Endo had seen being loaded
down with cargo. The captain, Captain Purlof, a rather fat, optimistic
old soul, is on the deck seated upon a large barrel, rocking slowly
back and forth. Behind him stands the XO, First Mate Inorem. He's a
rather sour looking elf, who shows great disdain for everyone,
including the only elf in the party, Skeeve.

Eomer leads the negotiations with the Captain, throughout which Inorem
contends with whatever the Captain says.

Purlof plans to head for Fort Boland on Mar Tesaro, then proceed to
Bayhaven on Grey Moor, and finally to Talosport on Mar Telos. Eomer
asks how much he would make per trip, hoping to be able to pay extra
to get him to go to Mar Telos first. The elf cuts in, refusing to
divert the course, whereas the Captain insists they will gladly divert
for 100 gold.

As for passage on the ship, the captain says he will take 25 gold
each, but will gladly refund it at the end of the journey if they make
themselves useful. Inorem is enraged at this, insisting that they are
still passengers and should have to pay full price, regardless of how
they spend their time. The Captain gladly welcomes each upon their
acceptance of the offer, happily contradicting whatever comment First
Mate Inorem makes regarding their uselessness as crew.

A sailor with an air of authority walks, by giving a tour to the other
passengers. Meanwhile the other sailors are hard at work loading the
ship with more cargo. The party all begins to help with the loading as
Enoch goes below decks to pray for a safe journey. With the weight of
the new cargo, the ship gradually sinks lower and lower into the
water.

As the ship becomes ready to sail, a man comes running towards the
ship, yelling for it to wait, wearing only his underwear, his clothing
and sword held over his head. Behind him runs the half-orc blacksmith,
who's daughter is waving from the inn window, a sheet clutched to her
breast. As the man boards the ship the gang plank is raised leaving
the furious smith standing at the docks glaring.

> This was the introduction of Eric's new character. He and I had
> agreed on this little scene beforehand. What makes it funny was that
> earlier (back at the inn), Eomer had told Lucian, Eric's OLD
> character, to stay away from her.

As soon as all are settled the ship sets sail. Eventually they make
their way to the mess deck. An unshaven sailor wanders over to their
table and joins them. Skeeve greets him as he sits, which is more than
enough to loosen the sailor's tongue. A man who enjoys his own voice,
Nobert introduces himself as a member of the crew and cheerfully goes
on to fill them in on all the ins and outs of the crew, wandering
happily from subject to subject with little prompting from the party.

![The Ocean's Majesty](images/ship1.gif)

As it turns out, Endo was right in assuming that boxes coming from the
blacksmith were likely war supplies. The ship is selling weapons to
the northern states of Mar Tesaro, an island deep in some sort of
civil war.

The conversation then turns to Inorem, whom according to Nobert, the
crew dislikes. His rudeness and distaste for humans are more than
enough to keep him from favor amongst the crew. Inorem used to sail on
a much grander elven ship, but it was sunk in the battle of Bayhaven.
He'd been forced to take this position on a human crew and he resents
it. Half of the cargo hold is his, and he is free to use this ship
until he can make enough to buy his own. He does this by stacking it
to the rafters with weapons for sale at Mar Tesoro.

Nobert then goes on to explain that Beck used to be first mate, losing
the title to Inorem when the Captain offered to help Inorem get funds
for a new ship. The crew however misses Beck as such, liking him as
much as they hate Inorem. The crew also is very fond of the captain,
who they refer to as "Puffins" or "Puff". He runs a loose ship, but
his generosity with his pay make up for any faults.

Nobert rambles on about various things until he settles on his girl
Talla in Bayhaven, and he how is looking forward to seeing her. He
goes on to describe her many attributes, though none of them seem to
be her looks. After some time the men manage to turn his conversation
to Bayhaven. Bayhaven is fine, or was when the ship was last there.
The old town has been repaired and there was a huge harvest that year
up north. Their biggest problem is that goods are piling up on the
docks because there aren't enough ships to move everything. Several
were lost in the battle of Bayhaven, and a few others to pirates
before that. Other ships are floating goods for the war (which is more
profitable) so Bayhaven just isn't getting enough ships to move
everything.

Nobert takes leave when he finishes eating, saying he is needed on
deck. The others go to work for a bit then retire to their quarters
for the night.

### 23rd of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day is clear and bright. Around noon the party, all about
their duties, hear a ruckus on the deck. There they see a big crowd
gathered, a great conglomeration of sweaty sailors and noise. After
some shoving the party manages to work their way towards the innards
of the fray, only to find Beck and Nobert in the middle, preparing to
fight. The party finally surmises that Nobert and Beck had each had a
letter from their girl back home, only to find that she was one and
the same AND pregnant. After further discussion the two decide to
fight for her. The winner of the fight will get to stay a sailor,
loser will get all the money and go back to Bayhaven to marry Talla.

Inorem quickly steps in trying to settle it, pointing out that "This
is most certainly not how civilized people settle arguments and
certainly not on my.. erm.. this ship."

The captain however waves him aside with a brisk, "Go ahead, go ahead,
lets see the outcome. This should be a good show."

Both men quickly throw down their valuables in a pile as the mob of
sailors crowds Inorem out of the way. It is no contest. Beck easily
wins the fight, knocking Nobert out cold in less than a minute. Beck
looks through his pockets, making sure he didn't miss anything of
value to give to Nobert. He goes below, looking sad.

Someone dumps a bucket of sea water over Nobert, who despite the
numerous cuts, bruises, and one rather large lump upon the head, wakes
immediately, grins a wide, toothy grin, and shouts, "Congratulate me
boys, I'm getting married!" The crew all cheers.

### 24th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day arises, sleepy and full of sun. The seas sits calmly,
gently rocking the old boat. The party assembles over their evening
meal when they are approached by the man they had seen running from
the smith. He introduces himself as Thu'fir, settles himself down
amongst them and begins to talk. He likes to talk, mainly about
himself and his pet sword. He goes on and on about the number of
people he had killed with it, though when questioned they find that
the number is rather smaller than his bragging implies (namely 11).

### 25th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day is rainy, a steady chill drizzle, in which the crew works
steadily in alternating wind and rain.

Enoch, in his rambling about the ship (being a cleric, the crew will
not let him help), discovers that there is another cleric aboard and
decides to visit him the next day. The crew warns him that the other
cleric is a bit of a joke, quite old, blind, and deaf.

Enoch makes his way below decks to the infirmary. There he finds
Crolman, a human who looks to be a hundred years old and his
attendant, a young sailor who tries continually to make sense of the
old man's mumblings, hoping for a hint at what the weather will be in
the coming days. After some time and a bit of halting conversation
with the sailor Enoch surmises that Crolman had once been a cleric but
has now lost all his powers except for a gift of prophecizing the
weather, which Crolman foretells in fits and starts amidst numerous
comments on food and achy joints. While Enoch listenes, Crolman
suggests that he is hungry, thirsty, uncomfortable, and that the
weather will be fine for the next two days.

While Enoch visits the old cleric, Thordek looks for Beck. He finds
him in the carpentry shop of the ship, practicing his sword fighting.
Thordek watches as Beck's sword slices through the air, looking as if
it was drawing an elaborate picture inthe air as it flashes and
swirles, cutting and slicing.

Skeeve decides to go practice his flying.

### 26th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next day there is much talk amongst the sailors about Crolman as
he seems to be very disturbed and more confused and upset than usual.
Each has his own opinion about Crolman's odd sayings that day. Enoch
goes below deck to see what is going on.

In the infirmary he finds Crolman and his helper, Crolman going on,
mostly about food but quite happily tossing in random, cryptic
comments regarding the weather, and in all appearances quite
disturbed. The sailor attending him is listening carefully to each
word he says, attempting to get a straightforward answer out of him,
so intently that he rather absentmidedly gets his food and drink and
sets them down before him. Crolman, in his own little world, is quite
oblivious to him. Crolman sits in his usual spot feeling around on the
table before him obviously looking for his food, "Hungry!?
...Thirsty?!"

Crolman mumbles, "They won't like us. Not gonna be happy. Not our
friends."

"Hungry!?" Crolman exclaimes as he feels around for his food. "Gonna
rain. Big storm. The ocean's gonna fall on our heads. Two days off, "
Crolman continues, still feeling around for his food, " Watch the
sail. Tie it fast. Don't let it come loose!"

"Wet!" Crolman complains as he finds his food having put his hand in
it as he felt for it.

Enoch then goes back on deck to tell the others about the latest, more
complete news on the coming storm.

### 27th of Suncrest, 1501dy

The next morning the captain announces that they are drawing close to
Fort Bolland, and should reach it by morning. There is a storm
approaching, but they expect to reach shore well before it hit. The
men need to work fast to secure the ship and get it unloaded before
the storm hit. They need to get some of the dead weight (weapons) out
of the hold so they will be less likely to sink with the high waves.
Everyone needs to pitch in to make sure they are ready when the storm
hit, or the ship risks being smashed into the docks.

The standing rule is no shore leave in Fort Bolland, due to the war.
This is still the case, but the captain allows some of the crew to go
ashore and seek lodgings, since there is no sense in sleeping on a
ship in a storm at port. He asks for volunteers to stay up all night
and watch over the ship.

At dawn they make ready to port.

An hour later the island draws near. The storm is a ways off yet.
Everyone relaxes. It looks like they will port and unload well ahead
of the storm. As they approach, the sailor in the crow's nest sounds
an alarm. They draw closer and see that the city is laid to waste. All
has been burned. The lighthouse is dark, and the docks are smoking. A
lone and crudely built watchtower had been built on the coast with a
sign of an eye with a thorn through it.

![This is the image on the flag seen flying over the city.](images/flag.gif)


Fort Bolland has been defeated.

The captain concludes the south has conquered the town. Their only
hope is to sail around the north end of the island and head for the
city of Breakshore. If the city still stands they may buy the weapons
in the hold, or at least allow port and re-supply.

Inorem reminds him of the storm.

The captain replies that now the storm will work in their favor. Ships
of the south may well pursue them if not for the bad weather.

They bring the ship about and make for the north. As they turned they
see and hear the alarm being raised from the tower on shore. They can
see men scurrying about on the shore, archers obviously standing to
the ready should they come within range.

The captain orders that all the cargo be dumped overboard. They are
too low in the water and too slow to have any hope of reaching
Breakshore like this. Inorem protests. The Captain relents. The crew
is ordered to empty only the Captains' share of the cargo.

Beck meets the loaders in the cargo hold and suggests they
"accidentally" dump some of Inorem's stuff as well, since his stuff is
towards the front and they will have to climb over and around it to
get to the captain's.

Hours pass. The ship rises out of the water as it gets lighter. The
men are sweating and exhausted as they work steadily trying to get
ahead of the oncoming storm.

Inorem is furious about the cargo being thrown over. Skeeve tries to
calm him down. Inorem assumes it was the humans and dwarf who did it,
though Skeeve helped with quite a bit.

The ship pushes west at a good clip.

A whistle blows, sounding general quarters. The party comes up on deck
to see the sky a sick green. The air is still and quiet. The men look
apprehensive. It is very warm and humid. The ship stops moving as
there is no longer any wind.

The captain orders the men to secure the sails, and the officers and
the party are called to the navigation room.

The captain explains the basics of weather navigation, heading into
the wind, not worrying about where you're going, just ride up one side
of a wave and down the other, no sails, as the wind will push the ship
over, OR the mast will snap like a twig.

The storm draws nearer. The temperature drops quickly. Suddenly it is
wet and chilly. The sea begins to churn.

The sky grows black as the sun sets. Rain begins to fall. As the ship
is buffeted by the storm, they begin to take on water. The ship is
still riding low in the ocean. The captain sits by the wheel upon his
barrel. Two stout men, Thordek and Thu'fir are sent to the wheel. The
captain explains that the more they aim INTO the wind, the safer they
are. The sails are tied up and everyone else is sent below.

Skeeve begins offering random spells he can do. None of them are "make
the storm go away", so the captain sends him belowdecks with the rest.
Thordek and Thu'fir have no trouble keeping the ship on course.

Night falls. Inorem stands just inside the door and runs the damage
control operation. At first he sets the men to bilge, but it is a lost
cause. Water comes in too fast. He concludes they need to lift the
ship up or they'll sink. He orders all hands to begin hauling his
weapons up from the hold, and shoving them out the door. He goes out
and sets to pushing the crates overboard.

Beck is there to remind the party that they could have tossed Inorem's
stuff hours ago, made better time, and saved themselves a lot of
trouble during the storm. Inorem's greed has put them in greater
danger.

Sailors (along with Eomer) work furiously to haul the heavy cargo out
of the hold and get it overboard. Then, one of them loses his footing
on the slick steps. The crate hits the deck and burst open, releasing
an avalanche of broadswords down the steps. The hapless sailor is
caught in the flow and sliced up as he falls downstairs in the pile of
weapons. Eomer is right behind him, but quick enough to leap up and
place his feet on the railings, holding himself above the steps as the
swords and victim slid by beneath him.

> As a Rogue, Eomer's reflex saving throws are through the roof, so he
> always gets to make cool saves like this.

The steps are now coated with seawater, blood, and swords. Enoch is
called. He grants healing to the injured man, while everyone else goes
about the tricky job of gathering up the swords as they slide back and
fourth on the rocking deck. The cargo unloading operation is delayed
as all of this happens.

Above deck there is a horrific crack as the mainsail rips free,
unfurls and catches the wind. The loose ropes whip about violently in
the wind. Beck is sent out with Eomer to secure the sail (if they can)
or cut it loose (if they have to) lest the mast be broken.

Eomer and Beck struggle to secure the sail. They have to climb the
rope netting and recover the sail. Eomer is blown off as he reaches
and misses. He falls into a wet coil of ropes on the deck.

> Although, even the most nimble of characters can still have a bad
> roll once (or twice) in a while...

Eomer is still conscious after the fall but is hurt. He gets back to
his feet and attempts to climb back up. He climbs back up but nearly
falls off again, managing only to catch hold. The mast creaks loudly.
The ship is listing heavily as the wind shoves the vessel around. Not
wanting to waste any more time, Eomer and Beck draw their swords and
cut the sail free.

They climb down and get belowdecks again. Inorem stands by, furious
that the sail has been cut.

A wave wash over the ship. Thordek losses his grip and is knocked over
while sliding across the deck, getting caught in the the ropes.
Thu'fir holds on to the wheel.

When all recover, they see that the captain is gone.

| Beck yells, " Bring us about, we must rescue him!" over the wind.
| Inorem shouts, " Belay that! Hold your course!"
| Beck, "We can't leave the captain!"
| Inorem, "I'm in charge!"
| Beck, "You won't take his ship!"
| Inorem, "Going back is suicide!"
| Beck, "Leaving him is suicidal for you!"

They draw their swords and start to fight as they fall down to the
quarterdeck. With them gone, Thordek, Thu'fir, and Eomer are free to
choose who they will obey. Should they abandon the captain, or risk
the entire ship by trying to come about? Cutting accross the wind will
be very dangrous.

> Yes, Eomer is mysteriously on deck again, even though he went in.
> This is one of those moments where the DM lost track and slipped up.
> I guess he came back outside for some reason?

They choose to go back for the captain and begin trying to turn about.
As the ship turns accross the wind, they loose control of the wheel
and the ship turns sideways. Eomer and Thu'fir try to regain course.
Waves wash over the deck. Thordek looses his footing and slides away,
ramming into the railing.

A flash of lightning reveals the two combatants on the Forecastle
Deck. Beck has run Irnoem through. He pushes the elf off of his sword
and into the sea.

Thordek grabs the banister and tries to work his way down to the
quarterdeck.

The ship starts to list. A wave comes across the deck and the ship
begins to lean to starboard. Water pours over the deck. One of the
hatches dips below the water for a moment and the ship takes a big
drink. The wave relents and the ship corrects itself. Those at the
wheel find it is much easier to steer but nothing happens when they
do.

Beck shouts above the din, "The storm has pushed us too far south.
We're being drawn into Stonehelm!"

Lightning flashes, and they can see the dark rocky teeth of Stonehelm
jutting out of the water. There is nothing they can do. The ship is
beyond their control, and all they can do is wait to be dashed against
the rocks.

The rocks are hidden for a moment as they are engulfed by waves. A
moment later the wave passes and the rocks are even closer. There is
an overpowering crash as the ship is torn apart.

All manage to keep their weapons and armor, but are obliged to leave
their packs behind. Thordek and Thu'fir, dressed in scale mail, were
sure to sink unless they gave up their armor. Thordek suggests they
lock arms over the captain's barrel. They do so, and jump in, using
the barrel as a raft. Skeeve uses his arcane magic and takes to the
air. He lights his staff and provides light over a rock jutting from
the water. He acts as a beacon to the others. Enoch calls on his holy
powers and walks on water with Eomer and 3 other of the crew he grabs.
Together they head toward the rock where Skeeve hovers.

The ship slides beneath the waves, and they are left among the
churning waves. Everyone ends up at the rock, clinging to it. They
have no food, no water, no way to rest, and no idea which way land is.
Enoch passes out from exposure. Those that survive are exhausted,
hungry, and thirsty, barely holding on in the midst of the storm.

As the night draws on, the storm relents.

### 28th of Suncrest, 1501dy

Dawn comes at last to show that most of the crew has drowned. Many
bodies are face-down in the shipwreck-filled water about them. As the
sky brightens, they can see the island to the south, less than a mile
away. Of those Enoch saved, there are only two sailors left. Thordek
and Thu'fir are kicking their way toward shore. Enoch helps the others
get to shore walking on water.

Thordek and Thu'fir get to shore and are waiting for the rest. Bits of
the ship litter the beach.

Endo is gone.

Way down the beach they find Beck digging a hole with a part of a
stool as a shovel, making a grave. Nobert is dead, and Beck wants to
bury him. He finishes the shallow grave and puts Nobert in. After a
moment of silence, Beck resolves to travel with the party back to
Bayhaven and marry Talla.

It is drizzling and cold. Everyone is exhausted and has been without
food and fresh water for about 10 hours. Nobody has slept in over 24
hours.

Eomer goes off looking for Endo. Enoch casts helping hand (a mystical
floating hand that searches a 5 mile radius) The magical hand drifts
away in search of Endo.

Thu'fir and Eomer search for roots etc to eat in the woods. Beck gives
them the gist of the island by drawing in the sand (what he has seen
on a map.) Obviously they are near Stonehelm and the river. They are
not sure however, if the Alidians have taken Breakshore and decide to
try to avoid them. Skeeve levitates and finds the river Â¾ of a mile
west. Everyone heads to the river except Enoch who decides to stay at
the beach in case Endo comes. The dwarf rinses off in the river.
Thu'fir cleans up as well.

After some time, the hand returns without Endo, and then disappears.

Enoch rests on the beach with the two who were saved while waiting for
the others to return. Everyone else rests by the river. Thordek offers
the use of his helmet to carry water back to Enoch. Beck washes it out
and fills it. They walk slowly and carefully back to Enoch. Enoch
drinks, sharing with the other two who decide to rest a bit before
moving on.

After a rest, they head for the road, which should be somewhere south.

Thu'fir goes first, then Eomer, Enoch, Beck, Skeeve, then Thordek.

The party encounters a group of soldiers coming from the underbrush
ahead of them. They are scratched up and covered in leaves from
running through the brush. Immediately the soldiers begin to question
them. There are three soldiers and one unarmed soldier.

They conclude the party is a group of mercenaries come to help the
northerners, and attempt to arrest them.

The party refuses to surrender their weapons. The uniformed unarmed
man speaks in the ear of the head soldier and the group spreads out.

The party see this is leading to combat and act first. Skeeve summons
a flaming sphere, rolling it toward one of the soldiers. The
underbrush catches fire in its wake. Weapons are drawn.

The unarmed soldier stands behind the others, casting magic at the
party. It is a hard battle. Both Enoch and Skeeve had spent much of
their magic in the night before, and had not had time to refresh
themselves.

One by one the soldiers fell. Skeeve and the other wizard end up in a
sort of duel, tossing fire magic at one another. Finally the opposing
wizard backs into the underbrush for cover. Skeeve commanded a flaming
sphere to travel around him in a tight circle, setting the brush on
fire. Thus surrounded, the sphere rolls onto the wizard and he
perished in flames.

As the last soldier fell, Eomer cries out, "Isn't anyone everglad to
see us?!?!?!"

The party retreats for a few minutes, as the fire spreads. Eventually
it burns itself out on the soaked vegitation and leaves a smouldering
hole in the woods. The smell of burning skin and hair surrounds them.
The party scavenges for usable items amongst the dead.

Beck points out that these soldiers were without supplies, so
therefore they must have had a base or camp nearby. Eomer changes into
the guard's uniform he scavenged from the least damaged soldier,
disguising himself as one of the guards, telling his party to stay
about 200 hundred yards from him. He follows the way the soldiers had
come and finds a clearing with the remains of a fire and camp. While
searching the area Eomer finds a cut length of rope, the cloth
wrappings from iron rations, a dead soldier, obviously the captain of
the band they saw, who was wearing a scale mail and has a horn. His
neck has been snapped.

Eomer calls the rest of the party and they join him. Thordek searches
and finds four backpacks with bed rolls and three iron rations. He
also finds Endo's staff.

Eomer is concerned at this. He knows Endo would not have left this
behind on purpose. He searches as well, and using his knowledge of the
wild he determines that a horse had been tied here, then was ridden
east, towards Breakshore. Other horses were here and have gone west.
Skeeve, Thu'fir, and Beck each take a backpack. The party stays to
rest. Thu'fir starts a fire and the rest go to sleep. Thu'fir heads
about 100 yards toward the conquered town (west) to watch for any more
activity.

### 1st of Last Summer, 1501dy

At 1 am the party sets out on the road. They follow it to Breakshore.

![The village of Breakshore](images/breakshore.gif)

The city is a medium-sized village along the coast. There are no ships
in the port, which means they will not be escaping the isand soon.

Enoch and Skeeve go into town and head for the church. The church is
overflowing with books. They speak to the head priest who explains the
situation to them.

The Alidians (the southern forces) took the town without much
resistance about a fortnight ago. They took the mayor away, but left
everyone else alone. They commandeered a few farmhouses, took a goodly
supply of food, all of the horses, and slew a few men who resisted,
but they departed after a week and headed in the direction of Fort
Bolland. The lands here in the north are still under martial law, and
nobody is permitted to travel in the north without official papers.
Anyone found in the wilderness will be assumed to be part of the
resistance (of which there was very, very little) and arrested. The
priest suggests they might be able to travel to Crossway and appeal to
the local governor for papers if they explain their situation. They
might also be able to buy forged papers.

He also tells them he has seen Endo and that he had quickly left town
with a friend.

The rest of the party goes to the inn while Eomer goes to the priest
and tries get an explanation of whom Endo was traveling with.

The rest of the party goes to the tavern / inn. The bartender welcomes
them and says that meals were free for Alidian soldiers. Thu'fir
claims to be a soldier for a free meal.

He is quickly found out when the bartender checks with the priest.

The bartender offers to help. He explains that there were supplies
hidden in the smith's house but that the house had been taken over by
the soldiers.

## Mar Talos

Mar Talos is home to the Elves. Other races are not allowed to roam
the land, and must remain in the capital / port city of Talosport. It
is also the home of Sagemaster Teerin Forwinol.

Sagemaster was a major figure in our first campaign. He's over 400
years old. He is respected and known throughout the other islands and
Dunlock. He's wise, thoughtful, and slow to act on anything. He
prefers to watch and let things play out instead of getting involved,
even when he has the power to intervene. He loves peace, and gets
along well with other races.

Mar Talos has benefitted over the last 100 years with him as the
leader. The island is strong, prosperous and secure.

## Session 2

### 2nd of Last Summer, 1501dy (late morning)

Skeeve and Enoch have a conversation with the head priest. Apparently
Alidian solders now roam the land, which is under martial law.
Anticipating that perhaps resistance forces might take to the hills
and strike at them from the wilderness, the Alidians have decreed that
nobody is allowed in the countryside, or even outside of town. To
travel abroad openly, they will need travel papers. He suggests such a
thing might be obtained in the town of Crossway to the south, either
by appealing to the local magistrate and pleading their case, or
(perhaps) through forgery.

Skeeve thanks the man for his time, and the two turn their attention
to the piles of dusty books in the library. There seems to be far more
than one would expect in a town this small. Books fill every shelf,
cover every desk, and are piled in various corners of the room.

Most of the books are mundane histories or geneologies. There are also
books of heroic deeds. These are books written in flattering terms
about various nobles, and usually commissioned by the noble in
question. As a nobleman gets old, he will usually hire someone to
write a greatly exaggerated version of his life, and have it added to
the local library. The books have no value to anyone, except that the
nobles generally pay vast sums of money to have them written. The
church makes quite a bit from this practice, and so these books are
kept in the library alongside more serious works in order to encourage
the practice. There are an awful lot of these sorts of books here.

There is also a book of maps. In it, Skeeve finds a handy map of the
surrounding area:

![Northern Mar Tesaro](images/map_upper_mar_tesaro.gif)

Skeeve borrows a nearby stand and spends a few hours making a copy of
the map for himself. He also asks one of the scribes handy about the
overflow of books. The scribe explains that over a year ago (before
Crossway fell to the Alidians) the people of Crossway sent their books
north to Woodhurst for safekeeping. When Crossway fell, the people of
Woodhurst sent their books here. So, this town has rather a lot of
books from other areas.

One of the books catches Enoch's eye. It seems to be a book written in
an archaic form of common, (with bits of other old languages added,
seemingly at random) which makes it very hard to decipher. This would
seem to suggest that the book is quite old, although from the
condition of the book it seems to be new, perhaps less than a decade
old. This is sometimes the case when old, tattered books are copied,
but it is customary to note the purpose and origin of the original
work when doing so. This book has no such markings. Indeed, this book
is not signed or dated at all. And finally, every other page has been
left blank, as if the author expected someone to translate this work.

Enoch asks the scribe about this and he explains that the book has
floated from place to place for some time. Various scholars have taken
a crack at the old text, but none of them have been able to
successfully translate it. He adds that Chronicler Rhillos in the city
of Fol Thron (somewhere south, he doesn't explain further) has offered
a reward â€“ a bounty, if you will â€“ for anyone who can figure out what
the book is all about.

Enoch notices that some of the old text seems to be an old form of
common from Dunlock, his homeland. He gives it a try. A few hours
later, he has managed to translate the following:


<div class="document">
**Part I: The Mountain Elves**

*Editor's Note: What follows is not a proper history, but instead a
collection of tales and folklore from the inhabitants of Mar Tesoro.
These have passed on through the generations, doubtless with many
changes and alterations. The story usually varies greatly depending on
the geographical location and race of the storyteller. The most common
elements of the differing accounts are gathered here to form a single
tale. It is recorded here for archival and reference, not for any
supposed historical value. Indeed, many portions of the following are
highly unlikely and should be viewed with utmost skepticism.*

- Chronicler Norvus

In the earliest days of Mar Tesoro, the southern lands were inhabited
by a peaceful clan of mountain Elves. They were gentle and kind, slow
to quarrel and preferred music and wine above swordplay and bloodshed.
They lived on the slopes of the great mountain, which they named Mt.
Fiore, which means "the place of flowers".

The mountain was tall and green in those days, and was fair to behold
even in the cold of winter. Fairer still it was in the warm months,
when the slender trees would bloom large flowers and clothe the
mountain in white and gold. The tall peaks caught the spring rain and
made the lands below rich and fertile.

Few others visited the lands. Only a few Gnomes and fewer humans had
walked the slopes, and no Dwarf had even set eyes to the mountain in
those days.

But Dwarf-King Thul Marblade came at last to the shores of Mar Tesoro.
He came to the Elven chieftain Ellas Morad, and asked for leave to
climb the mountain. "For", said he, "it is the way of all Dwarves to
seek the mountains and learn their ways."

Morad gave him permission to walk the slopes, and the Dwarf departed
at once. With him were many strong but grim Dwarves of his kind. As
they ascended, a powerful greed came over them, for they saw that the
stone of the mountain was filled with both silver and gold in plenty,
as well as many fair gems and rare stones. Never in all the Earth had
any Dwarf seen such abundant riches, and they marveled that such
wealth had lain undisturbed for so long.

Thul Marblade climbed to the pinnacle of the tallest peak, and there
he spoke to his kin, "Brothers, here lies the greatest of all
mountains of the Earth. Behold how rich it is with treasure, how bold
and strong its rock, and how kingly its shape! Surely we must build
here a mine, or we are no Dwarves at all."

His company agreed, and they departed from the mountain.

Enoch shows the scribe his work, and the scribe suggests he take the
book with him. He requests that he show it to the scholars in Fol
Thron once he completes the task.

While Enoch translates the text at the library, the Eomer and Thu'fir
gather at the blacksmith's shop. Upon learning that the party had lost
many of their basic supplies in the shipwreck, he suggests they help
him with a problem he's having.

Before the city fell, he had stored away a cache of weapons, armor,
and other provisions in the case of invasion. When the attack came, it
happened a bit quicker than he anticipated, and he didn't have time to
reach the supplies or distribute them. Worse, soldiers came and siezed
his house and have been living there ever since. The supplies are
hidden in a secret room in the basement, but he can't hope to sneak
past the guards to reach them.

The blacksmith suggests that the party try to sneak in and retrieve
the items. If they do so, they can keep some of the stash for
themselves. The only requirement is that they not kill any guards. If
they do, the soldiers will simply retailiate by coming into town and
killing people in order to exact revenge.

Eomer asks about what unforms the northerners used. It turns out they
didn't have proper fancy uniforms like the Alidians, but instead wore
simple black sashes around their waist or arms.

Thu'fir asks what they have been fighting about. The blacksmith
explains that the war was over territory. Apparently there is a
valuable mountain here called Mount Khelberg. It seems to be a rich
source of both gems and gold. The blacksmith explains that the
mountain is the birthright of his people: King Lorman (their leader)
is the great great great (etc) grandson of the first foreman of the
miners. He dug the first shafts and the land should be his. This is
why they attacked the Alidians.

Finally Eomer get back to the subect of the supplies they need to
steal.

Gereg draws a quick map of his house.

![A crude drawing of the layout of Gereg's house.](images/map_house.jpg)

There is a front door on the house that faces west, towards the town.
Behind the house is a storm door that leads into the cellar. There is
a secret door in the cellar that conceals the goods in question.
Unfortunately, the door is barred from the inside, so they can't just
pick the lock to get in. Someone will have to sneak in the front door.

Right behind the house, about ten feet from the rear door, is the
woods. Gereg suggests leaving the heavy items there in the woods where
he can recover them later.

By this time the sun is going down. Eomer goes east through the woods
to the backsmith's shop, which is a ten-minute walk. Everyone else
gathers at the tavern and waits with a glass of ale. (Skeeve has Tea,
Enoch abstains.)

Eomer watches the building as the sun sets. It looks like there is a
circle of tents in front of the house, and a number of guards are
gathered there, talking. He sneaks up to the back of the house and
peeks through the rear window with his mirror.

A soldier is inside, working on something. Eomer can hear the banging
of pots. This room is clearly the kitchen. After watching the place a
bit longer, he returns to town.

They discuss their plans. Thu'fir suggests that instead of sneaking in
the front door, they could just pull off the hinges. They worry that
perhaps this would be too noisy. Enoch points out that he could create
a zone of silence. This magic power of his will deaden all noise in a
20-foot radius.

They agree on this. Skeeve decides to stay at the tavern. He realizes
they have no place to stay for the night. The soldiers tooks several
houses, and the displaced families have filled the small inn.

Beck cuts in, suggesting they go in fighting. He's clearly drunk.
Thu'fir buys him another drink, and gives the bartender enough money
to keep them coming all night. They slip out and leave Beck to his
ale.

Eomer, Thu'fir, Enoch, and Thodek sneak through the woods to Gereg's
house. Enoch and Thodek stop well short of the house, not wanting to
make a lot of noise in their heavy armor. Eomer moves forward silently
and looks around.

Juding from the light, there is a campfire in front of the house. He
listens carefully and determines that two guards are having a
conversation. Using the mirror, he peeks in the window, but it is dark
and quiet inside. He gives the signal, and Enoch casts silence on the
door. Eomer takes the hinges off and Thu'fir takes the beam off. The
beam falls soundlessly down the steps within the zone of silence.

Eomer sneaks in and goes to the secret door, which is a pegboard of
tools. He moves one of the tools and finds it makes a very slight
sound. The door is just outside of the silenced area! So, he needs to
open a door which is covered in hanging metal tools, and he must do so
without making any noise. He takes a deep breath...

...the door opens silently. He signals to Thu'fir, who is at the
bottom of the steps looking in, letting him know where the edge of the
zone is. They begin moving boxes. There are seven boxes of varying
sizes, plus a sack and some other loose goods. Thordek and Enoch help
move goods from the house into the woods, just on the edge of the
zone. There are seven crates, a sack, a book, a lantern, and a
longbow.

> Can you spot the DM mistake?

The goods unloaded, they realize that Eomer needs to stay inside when
they put the door back on. If they want to hide all traces of their
work, then he needs to place the bar on the door again, which can only
be done once it's in place and closed.

Enoch casts silence again, since he guesses that the five-minute
duration is nearly up. They replace the door, attach the hinges, and
Eomer places the bar on the door again. While this is happening, the
members outside see a group of five guards head off towards town,
carrying a torch. They conclude they can't do anything about this now.
They have to wait for Eomer.

Eomer, still inside, must sneak upstairs, out the front door, around
the house, and meet them in back. He makes it upstairs and to the
front door without difficulty.

Just before he leaves the house he pauses. He goes around into the
kitchen and checks it out. He finds lots of dry goods. He also finds a
sack of iron rations. He opens one, pisses on it, and then carefully
re-wraps it and places it back in the sack.

He slips out the front door and rejoins the party out back.

While this was going on, Thu'fir had gone through the crates,
suspicious of the smith's story and wanting to make sure the story
they had been told was true. He found the following:

* 3 bucklers
* 3 tindertwigs
* Very large bundle of arrows
* Several longswords wrapped in blankets
* 30 iron rations
* Another map
* A purse of gold.
* A very ornate horn
* A pile of blankets
* 3 iron skullcaps
* 10 sets of heavy boots
* 10 empty water skins
* breastplate
* Longbow
* lantern
* map case
* several backpacks

They take enough backpacks, blankets and waterskins to supply the
party. They take enough food to supply themselves for two days, and
they take the horn. They leave everything else hidden in the bushes.

The party sneaks back into town, on the way seeing a number of
soldiers leaving, heading back towards the house. They are rolling a
large barrel. They crouch down and consider taking these guys out.
Eomer points out they could kill these guys and hide the bodies in the
woods or dump them in the ocean. Enoch responds that even if the
bodies are never recovered, the Alidians will still assume the townies
are responsible, and take revenge on them anyway.

The party goes to the tavern. Beck is passed out at the bar. The
bartender is red-faced and wearing a large bruise on the side of his
face. They realize the soldiers must have come here and taken some
ale. They wake Beck.

His head snaps up, "Alright! Let's go get those guys." He doesn't
realize they have already finished.

They lead him out of town to where Skeve has made camp. Skeeve
examines the horn and identifies its magic properties. Apparently if
you blow the horn it will stun anyone caught in front of it. The horn
will be unnaturally loud, as well, perhaps even reaching miles away.

Thu'fir goes to the blacksmith and lets him know how things went. He
shows him the horn. The blacksmith tells him the owner of the horn
died several days ago, killed by Alidian soldiers. Thu'fir gives him
fifty gold for it anyway. They look over Thu'fir's map and Gereg
explains that if they want to avoid the road, then there are two ways
they can travel south.

![Northern Mar Tesaro](images/map_upper_mar_tesaro.gif)

"The first way is that you could head west, cross the bridge, and then
head south through Upper Bolwood. The woods are dense and unyielding,
and some travelers tell tales of Ettins prowling on the edge of the
woods from time to time. If you come through the woods you should find
yourselves in the village of Woodhurst.

"The other way you could go is to head due south over Tinderward. This
would be much faster by my count, but it would take you over flat open
grasslands where you have no hope of hiding. If you encounter the
enemy soldiers, you'll be discovered for sure. Furthermore, you would
have to pass over the Weather Hills, which are home to a nasty and
devious tribe of Goblins."

Thu'fir examines the map before he replies, "Which way would you say
is the most dangerous?"

Gereg shruggs, "Beats me. I always take the road."

In any case, Gereg has no idea which way Endo went. Thu'fir thanks the
blacksmith and returns to the party where they debate over what path
they should take. There is much discussion about which path would be
better. They argue about which way Endo might have gone, and if he
would want them to follow him. Eventually they decide on the south
way, over Tinderward. They sleep.

### 3rd of Last Summer, 1501dy

At dawn they set out. Beck awakens but doesn't seem to be too hung
over. He doesn't say anything about the night before.

They move south, passing several small farms and into the open
grasslands. Eomer leads them at a strenuous pace. As the day wears on,
Thu'fir notices that several back birds have been circling them for
most of the day. The birds are too distant to be identified, but their
dark outlines can be seen clearly against the blue sky of late summer.

The birds are too distant for them to do anything about it. The day
passes as the hills to the south draw near.

As the sun drops low they see the outline of Joland Village ahead.
They wonder what to do about this. Is the town occupied? Certainly
they shouldn't just march into town together. Eomer puts on the "good"
Alidian uniform they own (the other one is bloody and slashed) and
walks into town alone, while the others hide in the grass outside of
town.

Dusk settles as he enters town. The little village is very quiet.
Angry eyes peer out at him from the homes, but nobody speaks. A old
man is sitting on the stoop in front of the blacksmith shop. He's
rocking back on his chair, looking thoughtful. He has a hard, creased
face and a bushy white mustache.

At last he looks at the uniform and greats Eomer, "You lost, friend?"

Eomer is evasive, but as they talk his ruse about being in the army
wears thin. He is alone and speaking with the wrong accent to be an
Alidian.

Finally the man asks him, "You're not an Alidian, are you?"

Eomer doesn't need the disguise anymore, "No, I'm not."

The man cheers up at this and introduces himself as Polan. He is the
closest thing the town has to a leader. He asks how the towns to the
north are doing. It's clear he doesn't have any idea the north has
lost. When Eomer tells him that Fort Bolland and Breakshore are taken,
the man concludes that the war is over. He looks sad.

He asks if Eomer knows anything about missing children. He doesn't.
Polan tells his story:

"About four days ago one of the little ones, a kid about seven years
old, disappeared from the fields just north of town. Two days later,
other kids were picking hardberries at the bushes over yonder", He
points to an area west of the town, "and the kids say a man jumped out
of the bushes and took one of them and carried the little girl off.
Now, the soldiers took all our weapons when they took this town. That
don't matter much â€˜cuz they also took all the young men and women
capable of using weapons. All we have left are the sick, the old, and
the children."

Eomer asks where the parents are. Polan explains that the mothers are
here in town, but the fathers were taken south weeks ago.

Eomer gets up and calls the other party members into town. It's
obvious the enemy sodiers left this town to its fate ages ago and
aren't likely to come back any time soon.

He explains the situation as the evening closes in. By the time he's
finished the tale, it's dark out.

Thordek and Eomer want to go right now and look for the kids.

Skeeve is not so sure, "Look, we don't even know if the children are
still alive."

Beck shruggs, "Sure, but the guy who took them is, and we can at least
fix that."

A debate ensues. Skeeve is sensitive to the plight of the villagers,
but doesn't want to get dragged into helping everyone they meet on the
way. He reminds them that they are chasing Endo, who left over a day
ahead of them, riding horseback.

Enoch insists he will go and look for the kids, even if he has to do
it alone.

> way. It would be easy to just take every quest handed to you by an

Thus overruled and outnumbered, Skeeve agrees to go along, but
suggests they wait until morning.

Eomer and others protest, wanting to begin now. Polan suggests that
trying to track someone in the dark, even with the aid of magical
light, is foolish.

The party relents and checks into the inn.

### 4th of Last Summer, 1501dy

At morning they gather and interview a few people. They learn that the
children saw a man in a robe with a beard. That is the extent of what
they can recall.

The party walks to the fields in the north and looks for clues. They
find nothing. They go to the hardberry bushes and look for clues.

![This is the special "DM" map I made for this quest. The players did
 not see it of course, but this will help readers to follow along. I
 hope.](images/map_tracking.gif)

They are at the base of a hill, facing west. The bushes are at the
foot of the hill. Assuming the kidnpper went west, he must have gone
around the hill to the northwest or southwest. The hill is steep
enough that it would be impossible for an encumbered human to walk up
it without leaving some fairly obvious marks.

Thordek searches. Upon further investigation, he sees an opening in
the center of the bush. It looks as though someone hid themselves in
the deep parts of the bush and then leaped out, breaking many small
branches in the process. The hollowed-out space is barely big enough
for a man. Assuming this hole is related to the missing children, then
what they seek must be man-sized or smaller.

Thu'fir also searches. He finds a small basket in the deep part of the
bush. It is partly filled and looks to have been dropped (not hidden)
suddenly.

Thordek and several party members go northwest, and Thu'fir leads the
rest southwest.

They come to a point where the southern slope is less steep and it is
possible to walk down. From here they can continue to follow the ridge
around the hill (heading west) or go south into the valley, towards
the river.

There are no visible prints to be seen on the slope going down.
Thu'fir's knowledge of wilderness lore tells him that even a child
walking alone could no descend the soft grassy slope without leaving
some hint. They continue west.

Both groups reunite at the other side of the hill, which is now east
of them. They are on the edge of a watery glade. The water is still
and filled with reeds. Insects drone nearby in the early morning sun.
If someone passed throughthe water they would be hard to follow. The
party decides to go around the glade to the south.

Eomer does a careful search and finds a hardberry along the way
leading southwest. It sits alone in the grass. They do not grow
anywhere near wet areas, so this berry must have come from elsewhere.
This is the first clue they have seen in some time that suggests they
are on the right track.

All the party is now together. As they progress west, the area becomes
thicker and many drooping plants grab at them and hinder movement.
Jaggers poke them from among the thick weeds. They emerge in a very
small clearing, and see that they are at the southern edge of the
glade. They have clearly found themselves on a path. They can follow
the path west, or south towards the river. To the north is the boggy
water.

Thordek searches and finds several strands of light blond hair caught
on a jagger bush. They hang at about eye level for a human, (which is
above Thodek's head, since he's a Dwarf) hinting that they either came
from an adult or from a child being carried.

They continue. The path is plain and easy to follow. It heads west and
then north, tracing the edge of the glade. They come to a group of
large dreary willow trees. Their long branches reach down and touch
the edge of the water. They look out across the bog, where east of
them is the hill where they began their search.

Many large insects and a few butterflies are moving about here. They
can hear the chirping of many other insects.

The path turns west from here. The path ahead becomes rocky and begins
to climb upward. On either side, tall trees lean inward over the path,
forming a great green canopy overhead. Foul black birds caw at them
from above as they pass.

They discuss the birds. Are these related to the birds that watched
them crossing the plains yesterday? None of them seem to have enough
knowledge of the wild to tell. They move on.

A small cliff rises in front of them. The wall is a rough tumble of
huge boulders about 20ft high. There is no longer any path visible,
but from here they can go north or south along the cliff wall, or
climb it.

Eomer searches and notices some moss has been disturbed on the rocky
ground to the south. A small patch has been scraped away, which may
indicate someone has walked here in the last few days. They decide to
go south.

Suddenly Thordek bids the party to halt. He has spotted a tripwire
across the path. Eomer examines it, finding that it leads to a pile of
large rocks that look out-of-place atop the cliff-like slope. It's
easy for them to figure out that the wire probably causes a torrent of
falling rocks to spill accross the path. Instead of disabling it, they
simply step over the tripwire and move on.

After a few minutes the cliff gives way and they come to an open area.
They walk over the green field for several minutes. Ahead, they see a
wide stone ruin. It was once tall, but weather and age have thrown the
stones down and they now lay in a broad heap. All that remains is a
ring of stone making the outer wall of where the structure once stood.
Broad steps lead up to what was once the inside of the building. The
"interior" floor is covered in scattered stones.

Thordek studies what remains of the stonework. He determines the
building was made perhaps 200 years ago. It is not of Dwarven make,
and is most probably of Human design. Given the configuration of
blocks, he guesses that the building was probably a church or temple.
It was not a fortified structure, at any rate.

Walking around the structure, they find two sets of cold stone steps
leading down into the basement.

## Grey Moor

![](images/map_grey_moor.gif)

Grey Moor was the site of our very first campaign. At level one, the
players stepped off the boat in the city of Bayhaven. By the time they
were done they had walked all over the island many times, broken an
evil curse that was killing the crops and draining the land of life,
and then joined in a battle to prevent a single greedy nobleman for
siezing control of the Island. Along the way they teamed up with Eomer
and Endo and attained level 3.

Grey Moor is about 90% human, 5% halfling, and 5% "everyone else".
Dwarves are known to live in the mountains but their number is not
known so they are not included in this total. Elves are very uncommon
and usually never leave Bayhaven. The whole island is seen as rather
bumpkin-ish to the other islands.

The area north of the mountains is uninhabited. The coast this mostly
low rocky cliffs or very steep slopes. In other places, the coastal
area is shallow and rocky. This means that for a majority of the
island it was difficult or impossible to bring in large ships safely.

Bayhaven was the only good port for ships capable of inter-island
travel. The others couldn't support much more than small fishing
vessels. It is also the biggest and most sophisticated city.

The town of Stackroot is home to a modest but profitable gemstone
mine. About a third of the population is Halfling. The Halflings work
the mine, while the humans handle the governing of the city and
growing of crops.

A little infomation on the city of Bridgehold and Highstone Monastery
can be gleaned from Endo's backstory.

The other cities are just tiny little farming villages and not worth
mentioning here.

At the end of our first campaign, the players had founded a new city,
knocked a nobleman out of power, and established the council of Grey
Moor.

## Session 3

### 4th of Last Summer, 1501dy (early morning)

The day is overcast. Above ground this church is destroyed. All that
remains is a two-foot wall making the outline where the building once
stood. The building was made from large stone block, and large pale
stones are scattered throughout the tall grass. Inside, two sets of
stairs (one on each side of the building) lead down into the earth.

Thordek notes that a large curving stairway leads down into a dank
basement area. Black staining along the bottom of the stone block
walls shows that this area is damp or flooded during some parts of the
year, although it's dry right now. At random, they choose the southern
set of stairs to investigate.

Thu'fir listens carefully at the top of the stairs. Nothing. They head down. Eomer stays behind to guard the entrance.

> Pat missed the first couple of hours of this session, so aside from
> dealing with some locked doors, his character (Eomer) remained
> behind. This really hurt the group, since a rogue would have made a
> lot of the challenges they faced much easier.

![](images/uc_map1.gif)

The room is empty aside from the door leading north. It is locked.
Skeeve goes upstairs and gets Eomer so he can unlock the door for
them.

The keyhole is rusty. Eomer attempts to pick it but can not open it.
He manages to jam the lock in the attempt. Since they can't enter this
way unless they force the door, the party decides to try the other
entrance.

![](images/uc_map2.gif)

This room is the mirror image of the southern one. There is a large
stone block, about 3x3 foot (looks like one of the major blocks from
upstairs) The top of the block is stained with old blood. An axe rests
on the stone. There is a small pile of chopped firewood here, beside
the chopping block. There is a locked door leading south.

Skeeve calls Eomer to help him try this door. Eomer fails again. Once
again, the lock is jammed. They have now jammed both entrances. They
talk about what to do next. The doors are old rotting wood, but the
wood is quite thick and framed in iron.

Thordek finally grows tired of debate and begins hammering on the
northern door. The sound is tremendous, and echoes in the small room.
They know they have lost any chance at surprise or stealth.

After nearly an hour of labor, Thordek has broken open the bottom half
of the door, allowing the party to squeeze through. They find
themselves in a hallway that looks like it was once nicely decorated.
The remains of a rug, now tattered and consumed by mildew, runs down
the center of the floor. Directly opposite of them is the other set of
double-doors that they jammed earlier.

![](images/uc_map3.gif)

They check the hallway. From here they may go south through a new set
of double doors, or explore a single door that faces north. They
examine the double doors, then turn back and go through the single
door.

![](images/uc_map4.gif)

This is a dining area. A large rustic wooden table sits in the center
of the room, along with a single chair. The table looks newer than
other wooden items (such as doors) you see about. While suffering from
bad moisture damage, its certainly "new" compared to other items
around. It and the chair look to be poorly made. They are rough and
unevenly cut from untreated wood.

Thordek searches the room and finds a silver fork under the table. He
also notices a few crumbs on the table and chair that indicate they
have been used recently. They note that there is a door in the room
but decide to look back the hallway a bit prior to looking in there.

As they move in front of the double doors, a large trapdoor opens
beneath them. Thu'fir falls but Skeeve catches himself on the edge,
dropping his staff in the process, almost falling in himself.

Thu'fir lands in darkness twenty feet down, on a set of sharp spikes.
Thordek pulls Skeeve up. Skeeve cries out the name of his staff,
"Sucursis!". The staff obeys and returns to his hand. He casts
levitate on Thu'fir and they help him out of the hole. Enoch heals his
wounds, which are severe, but not life-threatening.

While still levitating Thu'fir moves over to the door to open it, and
floats through. The others prepare to jump across. The jump is a bit
difficult, since they must jump diagonally over the pit and through a
doorway. The diagonal means they can't get a good running jump, and
the door frame means they can't shorten the jump by cutting the
corner. The jump is only four feet, but will still be a bit tricky.
Skeeve casts jump and leaps across without effort. Enoch and Beck
follow. Thordek falls in. Skeeve casts levitate to lift him out. They
are now in another hallway, similar to the last. There are two doors
along the south wall.

![](images/uc_map5.gif)

Much to the dismay of the others, Skeeve knocks on the first door.
When he gets no answer, he shrugs and opens it. A huge, vile
centipede, ten feet long and the width of a small tree, scuttles
forward as he opens the door. Its ugly, eyeless head raises up and
bites him on the chest.

The party wants to move in to attack, but Skeeve is in the way. He
wants to retreat but they have all gathered around him. The battle is
a disorganized mess. Skeeve hurls magic missiles and the fighters
bring their weapons to bear. Skeeve earns himself another severe bite
on the chest and passes out. The hammer of Thordek and the blade of
Thu'fir begin to tear the creature apart. Enoch burns it with a beam
of holy white light. Skeeve wakes up and crawls away. Thu'fir chops
part of it off. Beck finishes the thing with two quick stabs from his
rapier.

Enoch heals Skeeve.

With the battle over, they step over the nasty carcass and examine the
room.

![](images/uc_map6.gif)

This room looks to have been some sort of dorm room once. The remnants
of a ruined bed frame sits in one corner, as well as a few bits from a
rotted desk which now sits legless on the floor. Thordek searches the
room and finds nothing. They move on to the next room.

Enoch *carefully* peaks into this room. It is entirely empty, although
the northeast corner bears the mark of new construction. There is an
area encased in more rough wood. While crude, it is heavy and sturdily
made.

![](images/uc_map7.gif)

Thordek tries to smash it. Bam, bam, bam! The others comment on his
obvious dwarvish-ness. "Is he trying to dig a new mine?" says Beck.

After a half hour or so the wooden walls give way to his hammer. He
finds that there is a big contraption here with crossbow bolts. It
points out into the hallway. If it were to fire, it would come out of
a picture frame (through the canvas) and traveled north down the hall.
They note that out in the hallway there is another picture facing
south.

Looking at the pictures more closely, they see that they are "new".
The frames are cheap and the paintings are quick, simple pictures.

Making sure everyone is out of the hallway, Thu'fir attempts to take
the crossbow bolts out and disable the machine. He breaks the
mechanism.

They leave the room. There is another painting out in the hallway that
faces east. Thu'fir takes the painting down, but finds no trap behind
this one.

Thordek carefully looks in the next room.

![](images/uc_map8.gif)

This room looks to have once been some sort of dorm room. The remnants
of a ruined bed frame and rotting desk are piled together with newer
filth. Several Alidian uniforms are piled here, slashed and burned to
rags. There are newer bones (small bones) on top of the pile, and a
few iron ration wrappings.

Thordek examines the bones and determines they are probably from small
game, and not children as they at first feared.

Thordek looks down the hallway carefully. He finds a painting stuck
firmly to the wall. It faces south, opposite the crossbow trap
painting they encountered earlier. After some debate, Beck walks over
and cuts the canvas off, finding a crossbow trap concealed behind it.
They discuss how to disable the trap and whether it needs disabled.
They elect to leave it alone for now, since it shouldn't pose much
threat now that they are aware of it.

Thordek notices a foul odor from the next room. He cautiously opens
the door.

![](images/uc_map9.gif)

This room smells like excrement. The stench was bad BEFORE the door
was opened, and now it is overpowering. Using his dark-vision, Thordek
can see that some of the stones have been pulled loose from the floor
and a latrine hole has been dug here. There is a pile of recently cut
leaves beside the pile. Thordek quickly shuts the door.

They follow the hallway the rest of the way around, turning west and
then going thorough the door at the end, which they already suspect to
be the kitchen. Beck stands outside the room and Enoch enters.

The kitchen was obviously as filthy as the rest of the basement, but
it is clear that someone has taken time to clean this area. The
counter-top looks to have been recently replaced by a fresh piece of
raw untreated wood. The wood still bears bloodstains. There is a stone
fireplace on the east wall. A cooking pot hangs over the cold ashes.

There is a basket of mushrooms here on the counter, and a stale loaf
of bread. A pile of wrappings and strings from iron rations sits in
one corner. Also on the counter are a few other food prep items:
knives, spoons, and such.

There are three doors in here. Enoch tries the door to the south.

This looks like a small food pantry. The shelves are mostly empty,
although there are a few items here: 7 iron rations and a few small
vials of spice. There is also a canister of salt. Enoch takes the
food.

Thordek comes to the kitchen to see for himself. As he walks to the
door, the floor gives way, dropping him and Beck down 20 feet onto
more spikes.

Skeeve levitates them out and Enoch heals them.

At this point they are spent. Everyone is tired and injured a little.
They have been in here only a few hours, although this seems like a
long time for such a small place. They decide to rest before
proceeding. Enoch and Thordek take the table from the dining room and
lay it over the hole so the others may use it as a bridge instead of
jumping. They retreat to the front door. Beck protests that they ought
to sleep outside of the door they smashed in. The hole is a bit
difficult to climb through, and Beck believes it would be better if a
foe had to emerge from the hole to reach them. Also, he didn't want
everyone to have to struggle through the gap if they needed to escape.

The others ignore him and they bed down in the hallway. Eomer keeps
watch.

As they rest, Thordek and Enoch ponder the trap doors. Why did they go
off when they did? At first they suspect that a certain weight is
required to trigger them, but that doesn't seem to match with events.
At last Thordek realizes that the trap doors are activated the *third*
time someone puts his weight on them.

### 5th of Last Summer, 1501dy

Four hours after the party began their rest, Eomer rouses the them
with a yell, "Hey, I heard something!"

Before they can act, another centipede is on them. They leap to their feet and engage it. This time the fight goes more smoothly and the thing dies without inflicting much harm.

Skeeve has recovered his magic, but Enoch has not. They elect to move
on at this point anyway. They head down the hallway and find the trap
door has been reset, and is now closed again. Not wanting to set it
off again, they jump over the solid ground. Thordek mis-jumps and
lands on the trap area. This doesn't set it off. A few other party
members make the jump, and then Beck fails. The trap springs, the door
opens, and he falls.

They are confused by this. Wasn't this the second time it was touched?
Thodek points out that the centipede would have been the first thing
to cross it, making Beck the third.

They levitate him up and Enoch heals him. They lament once again that
they lost their ropes in the shipwreck.

They follow the hallway around until they are on the north side,
beside the trap door. They go into another room which is not a filthy
mess like the others. The door is left open a bit.

![](images/uc_map10.gif)

A crude bed frame is here, built from newly cut, untreated lumber. The
mattress looks like two blankets, sewn together and stuffed full.
There is a lantern on the floor by the bed.

They go to the next room. Thordek goes first and a trap door over the
entrance to this room drops a pile of stone blocks on him. He is
pummeled.

Eomer, sick of waiting outside, decides to join the party. Beck goes
outside, since this place seems too crowded for six people.

> Pat joined the game at this point. Up until this point in the
> session, Eomer has been an NPC.

![](images/uc_map11.gif)

This room is empty, save for a small wooden chest in the northwest
corner. Thordek walks over to it. The brash Dwarf attempts to open the
chest. Fine powder explodes from the chest, covering everything in the
room. Thordek manages to hold his breath, thus saving him from
breathing in any of the foul grey dust. He dashes from the room
looking like a floured dumpling.

Eomer rebukes him for being so reckless.

They wait twenty minutes or so for the dust to settle out of the air
in the room so that it will be safe to enter. Thordek goes back in and
searches the chest.

He finds a book, some gold, and a bleached human skull which is being
used as a bowl to hold some strange powder.

They open the next door. It is a simple room with a new wooden bed and
a small (unlit) lamp. The bed is poorly built but looks used. The
blankets are not filthy, rotting rags at any rate.

![](images/uc_map12.gif)

They move on to the final door. This is a large door facing east.
Before attempting to unlock it, they decide to deal with the trap to
the north, since it is pointing right at them and probably tied to the
door in some way.

Thordek wants to smash it, but Eomer has him back off so he can try to
disable it. He fails and sets it off. He tells Thordek to smash the
trap. Thordek walks over and whacks into the center of the mechanism
with his hammer. Bam! Four arrows shoot out over Eomer's head and into
the opposite wall. Thordek tries again and breaks the mechanism.

Eomer now moves onto the door. He tries to pick the lock but manages
to fail again. It is jammed.

Skeeve tells everyone to stand back, and then uses flaming sphere to
burn out the door. The door is engulfed in flames. The aged, thick
wood gives off a thick acrid smoke as it burns. The chamber is filled
with smoke and they retreat to the entrance for a while until the
smoke dissipates. The group is now concerned that if the children are
inside they may have asphyxiated.

They return to the door inside. The door frame and the lock are still
there but the wood inside the frame is burnt away. Thordek is chosen
to go in because he is smallest. He peaks in. He sees no one but sees
another set of doors. This is a small vestibule. This area looks
well-traveled. There is a series of switches on the north wall. Skeeve
and Thordek flip a few switches out of curiosity. Eomer is irritated,
but says nothing.

![](images/uc_map13.gif)

They enter the next room. This well-lit room was once the lower
meeting hall and has now been converted into a sacrificial chamber.
There are three stone slabs on the floor, tilted towards the middle of
the room, two with children lying upon them. Grooves have been carved
in the stone floor, leading into a drain in the center of the room, in
which a large bronze cup has been placed. As they move towards the
children they hear a voice from the front of the room, "Leave the
children be! You can't help them now. Go back to the town."

![](images/uc_map14.gif)

At the front of the room is a table with jars and evil books and other
nasty stuff. There is also a large spell-book.

The children seem to be under a spell of dreamless sleep. Eomer moves
closer to the children.

"Leave them be, none of you have the power to help them now," the
voice says as Eomer leans closer to see if they yet live. He can feel
no pulse. He places his mirror in front of the mouth of the boy, and
confirms that he is breathing very slightly. The children look deathly
pale.

"I am prepared to do what none of you would against the Alidians. It
is time that we return to our former glory", states the voice.

"Murdering children will do that?", asks Thu'fir. The others continue
to look for the source of the voice.

"It's time that we go back to our roots. We've abandoned the ways of
magic and that's how we lost the war," the voice persists, moving
around the front of the room accompanied by footsteps.

"Go back! You want to take these children back to their parents? Take
them back, so they can become slaves or killed by the Alidians? Their
death here will be quick, painless, and nothing like the horrors they
would suffer at the hands of the Alidians. If you want to help win
this war, go and bring me one last child. "

Eomer figures out pretty much where the wizard is. He nonchalantly
chats to the wizard, wanders over to the workbench, and starts tossing
and knocking over the stuff on the table. Eomer pulls the leg out from
the table and knocks it all over. The wizard appears near Eomer and
Enoch suddenly can't move. Enoch held, Thordek trying to figure out
what is wrong with him, starts shaking him trying to get him to wake
up.

The battle with the wizard begins. The wizard casts magic missile at
the them. Eomer and Skeeve fight him. Thu'fir picks up one of the kids
and runs from the room with him. Skeeve has been seriously wounded by
the magic missles, but summons his strength and casts lightning on the
wizard. The wizard is thrown back, badly injured. He responds by
hitting Skeeve with an acid attack. The acid splashes all over him,
and he passes out.

While this is going on, Thordek dashes into a side room, looking for
something he might throw at the wizard.

![](images/uc_map15.gif)

A quick glance around the room reveals this to be a workshop of some
sort. He grabs a hammer, and heads out of the room. Eomer attempts to
grab the mage but slides right off. Thordek sees that Skeeve is down,
drops the hammer, and tries to pick up both the kid and Skeeve. He
can't, so he just takes Skeeve. He realizes that Skeeve has acid
burning him and throws off the acid-soaked cloak. Thu'fir continues to
try to save the children. The wizard yells as they take the kids. He
looks and sees that the battle is against him. He casts another spell
and vanishes. Thordek screams for Beck to come help. Eomer uses Endo's
staff to swing in the area that he heard the wizard's footsteps (who
is now invisible) and hits, bringing forth many yells of pain and
frustration from the location of the wizard. Thu'fir blows his horn
and affects both Eomer and the wizard. They are stunned.

Thordek takes Skeeve out of the room and sets him carefully in the
rubbish room. Skeeve stabilizes. Thu'fir drops the kid gently outside
of the room and pulls the doors shut, hopefully trapping with wizard
inside with the party, and away from the kids. Thordek stays with
Skeeve, trying to heal him. The others listen for the invisible
wizard, trying to keep track of him. The wizard kicks at Eomer when he
tries to grapple him and loses his invisibility. He slips away and
shuts himself in the little workshop.

Eomer begins chatting at him through the door. Beck comes in yelling,
"What the heck is going on in here?"

Finally Thu'fir kicks the door in and slays the Wizard with his
massive blade.

Thordek looks around. He searches some of the rooms they haven't
checked. One room is piled high with old rotting furniture. Many old
pews have been shoved in here, along with other broken furniture.

![](images/uc_map16.gif)

The other room (where the wizard died) is a makeshift workshop. There
are many bits of cut wood lying around, along with a layer of sawdust.
A crude workbench is built here, which holds some very basic tools:
Hammer, nails, vice, and a few different saws. An incomplete chair is
on the bench.

On the floor near the overturned table they find a chalice of
purification. This strange cup will purify any water placed into it
after 10 minutes. Thu'fir claims this prize.

Out in the main hall, they rest. As soon as he has the power, Enoch
heals Skeeve.

Once rested, they take an inventory of the items recovered. Several
Alidian rank insignia are on the table in the main hall, stripped of
their silver and gold trim. The silver & gold are in a separate pile,
along with bits removed from jewelery and teeth. Thordek takes these
items to sell and divide the proceeds later.

Skeeve finds a mage's guild certificate of membership made out to
"Conjurer Vormoth", good until 1505dy. Skeeve takes this. Being a
self-taught wizard, he has never heard of the guild, but figures that
being able to pass himslelf off as a member may come in handy.

Thu'fir finds the wizards staff and gives it to Skeeve. Amongst the
other things until Skeeve can take a look at everything. Everyone
regroups in the main room, bringing the kids in as well, except
Thordek who has been checking all the rooms they had missed, gathering
up all the things they find.

Thordek searches the workshop and finds a secret room that grants
access to the second (northern) crossbow bolt device / trap.

![](images/uc_map17.gif)

Also in this room is a small wooden box with 800g worth of small gems,
500g, 2 potions of End Dreamless Sleep, and 1 cloak of absorb fire
damage.

They decide when they leave they will burn the wizard in his lair.
They fight about how to go about it. They eventually just leave him to
rot in his workshop.

Everyone rests and wake up around 5 am. Enoch sets about healing
everyone, and they decide to return to town.

## Session 4

### 5th of Last Summer, 1501dy

It is early morning. The group is ready to leave the dungeon and is debating whether to wake the kids now or in town. Eomer doesn't want to carry the children, but Skeeve doesn't want to deal with frightened, crying children. They decide to take them back to town first, then wake them. Thordek considers taking the powder in a skull then decides against it.

They head back to town, with Beck and Thordek carrying the kids.

As they go they are especially careful of the traps on the way back.
There is discussion on the way back about how everyone dealt with the
situation. Skeeve is irritated that so much valuable stuff was broken,
especially by Eomer. Skeeve thinks they should have let the wizard
live long enough to gather more information from him. They also
discuss the disorganized mayhem of the last battle, and agree they
need to use more teamwork in the future. The walk only takes about a
half hour, meaning they enter town just as the sun is rising.

They enter town with the kids. One of the mothers, who runs the inn
and thus is bustling about preparing for the day, panics about her son
being limp. Skeeve quickly explains and give the kids the potions to
wake them. The children are given back to their mothers and Polan
comes over to talk to them. He thanks them for saving the kids. Skeeve
explains about Vormoth being the one who took them. Polan seems to
recognize the name, but says nothing.

Eomer presses him on this point, trying to find out more about
Vormoth. Polan eventually confides that Vormoth was their mayor before
the invasion. When the town was conquered, he disappeared, and they
assumed he'd been killed or taken prisoner. He asks the party to keep
this quiet. He doesn't want the other villagers to know their former
mayor was the one behind the kidnappings.

Thu'fir asks more about the sacrifice, and mentions that Vormoth said
this was part of the "old ways". He wants to know if this is true, and
if Polan's people really did practice this sort of thing.

Polan hangs his head, "Yes, we used to practice human sacrifice. Well,
the wizards did, to make themselves powerful. It hasn't been done in
my lifetime though. Of course, back then the goal was to sacrifice the
enemies children, not your own." The group is appalled at the idea
that it was all right as long as those being sacrificed were the
enemies.

Polan gives them food, ropes, and free meals at the tavern. Thu'fir
asks around but there are no grappling hooks for sale. They lost their
climbing gear in the shipwreck, and the trouble with the trap doors in
Vormoth's lair reminded him that they needed to get some.

They check the map and plan their route south. The goal is to reach
the city of Crossway, where they hope to find their friend Endo, or at
least acquire some travel papers so that they may travel the country
freely.

![](images/map_upper_mar_tesaro.gif)

They must avoid the road, since it will be patrolled by Alidian
soldiers. They don't have traveling papers, which means the soldiers
will try to arrest or kill them if they are caught. They know the
Weather Hills are infested with vicious goblins, so they decide to
head west, cross the river, and then head south through the woods.

They march west for two hours and come to a river. The river is pretty
rough and about 30 feet wide. Enoch walks across the water, helping
all but Skeeve across. (His magic can grant water walking to only 5
people at a time) Skeeve flies across using his own magic.

They see a hint of a town to the far west. They decide to head south,
up out of the valley which they had been traveling in. They start
heading more or less south but heading a bit east due to the
landscape. They make excellent time as they get out of the valley.

They are not really sure where they are. From here they can climb a
large steep hill directly south, or they can continue southeast and go
around the hill. It is nearly 5 pm. Eomer requests that Skeeve fly up
in order to look ahead and see which direction they should go. Skeeve
levitates and can now see where they are. They have covered less than
half the distance through Lower Bolwood. Their detour around the
weather hills cost them most of the day.

They discuss which direction to go. They consider whether to head
towards the road and stay just off it or try going through the woods.
They decide to head due south, straight up the hill. The climb is long
and wearisome, but at the top they are all treated to a good view of
the surrounding country.

They now have a choice between heading southeast or straight south.

To the southeast they see a gap in the trees, hinting that there might
be a river that way. They head for the river. As they draw near, the
underbrush becomes more thick and tangled. It is getting dark. At last
they run into the stream. The stream runs straight north, so they are
able to go south along the bank. They need to rest for the night, but
don't want to make camp in this thick, unyielding growth. They go
south about half an hour and find a spot with less sticks and
brambles.

Thu'fir stays awake to keep watch.

### 6th of Last Summer, 1501dy

The night passes, Thu'fir doesn't notice anything. Skeeve wakes and
Thu'fir goes to sleep. In the late morning Skeeve hears some noise
around them, to the northeast. The sound comes closer then stops. He
suggests to Eomer when he wakes that they might be being followed.

Morning comes, they eat quickly and set out early. They head southwest
and come upon a pond. It is directly in their line of travel but is
small enough that they can go around it without losing much time. They
note a stink in the air. The musky smell doesn't seem to be coming
from the water, which seems wholesome enough. Skeeve skips a rock
across the pond.

They hear a crashing in the woods about 50 yards behind them. They can
see treetops swaying in the wake of something large headed their way.
They decide to walk across the water. Enoch casts water walking again,
and five of the party members begin running over the still surface of
the pond.

Skeeve wants to stay and see what this thing is. He considers climbing
a tree, thinks better of it, and instead jumps into a good covering
bush.

An Ettin emerges from the woods. The massive creature stands at nearly
fourteen feet tall. In one hand he holds a massive club, which is
itself longer than any of the party members. He screams at them in
some incomprehensible speech. Once it realizes it cannot catch them,
it turns away in disgust. Pouting, it smacks a nearby tree with its
club, nearly uprooting it.

The Ettin starts sniffing. It smells something nearby. Skeeve casts
fly and soars out of the bushes, heading for the other side of the
pond.

The Ettin is enraged by this. He is on the opposite side of the water
from them now, and making all kinds of angry noises at them and
standing in the mud. Skeeve drops a fireball on his head and angers
him more. They have a laugh at him and move on.

Thu'fir explains to them that the Ettin was not likely following them,
but that they had stumbled into his territory.

They can now either go south west where it is more open or go south
which is a little more tangled. They choose the way that is more open.
They head south from here. The land here is more open and they are
making excellent time. They eventually come to an open, treeless
field. A stream divides the field in two. Across the stream they see
another Ettin. They decide to go around, rather than getting into a
fight with the beast.

They travel a bit more south. As they move into late afternoon they
come across a major city, obviously Crossway.

![](images/map_crossway.gif)

They are north of Crossway, standing on the wooded hills looking down
on the city. They can see the city is guarded by a massive wall to the
south, but on this side they can easily slip in.

They watch the movement below as they discuss how to enter unseen.
They know this city is controlled by the Alidians. They want to avoid
the attention of the soldiers. Last time they met Alidian soldiers was
in the wild. The soldiers demanded to see the party's travel papers
(which they didn't have) and then assumed they were mercenaries. A
battle ensued. Although they won that battle, the odds would surely be
against them here in town with hundreds of soldiers about.

They know they must not attract attention. With their backpacks, they
will stick out quite a bit in the crowd. Their armor and weapons will
make them even more conspicuous.

Eomer plans to go into town to test things out. He wants to wait until
dark and hide in the shadows, but the others think they have a better
chance if they just hide in the crowd during the day. They debate for
a while on the merits of each plan. Finally they decide to separate
and slip in among the crowd, since traveling in a group would
certainly attract attention. Eomer points out a large tower on the
south side of the city. They agree to meet in front of the tower if
all goes well.

Enoch and Thordek enter together. They develop a cover story where
Enoch is a traveling healer and Thordek is his bodyguard. Eomer and
Beck will also enter together. The other two will follow seperately.

This city is a hub of activity. The north side of the city is the
housing district. Narrow, winding streets snake between the rows of
small homes. On the southern side of the city is the shopping bazaar.
It is a large circle of shops situated near the tavern. There is a
large stone keep overlooking the shopping district. The south side of
the city is guarded by a massive wall with a single wide gate, which
stands open during the day. A score of Alidian soldiers stands watch
at the southern gate.

They melt into the crowd easily as they slip into town one at a time.
Nobody gives them any trouble.

Eomer and Beck work their way through the masses, which, as they get
closer to the square, seem to be pushing away from the market toward
the outlying houses . The market is beginning to empty as the people
start heading towards home. Eomer finds that the keep where they are
all heading to is covered with Ailidian soldiers. This is their base
of power in the city, and the party has agreed to make it their
meeting point! He waits for the rest outside the market rather than
head to the keep.

Thordek and Enoch walk into town together. It is late afternoon, and
by now many businesses are closing. The crowd is moving against them
as it is moving towards the houses to the north and away from the
businesses to the south. They see the keep as they walk through the
square. The people here are mostly closing up shop. They make their
way to the keep which is crawling with soldiers. They decide to head
over to the church nearby. Enoch does his cleric thing, praying to
Pelor.

Eomer spots them as they enter the church and decides this is the new
meeting point. As the other members of the party approach, he silently
indicates they should head there.

Eomer and Beck watch the soldiers at the gate as they wait for the
rest. One group of soldiers marches out from the gate and relieves the
group there. They note six scattered soldiers different from the rest,
not being relieved from duty, wearing plain heavy armor. These
soldiers do not move. Their helmets are solid metal, with no holes for
eyes. The fronts of the helmets are stamped with the now-familiar
symbol of the Alidian army:

![](images/flag.gif)

The other soldiers seem very well organized as well. They travel in
groups of 7. They do not spend time chatting or sitting around. They
walk the streets alert and ready for action. People seem to give the
soldiers a lot of room.

Once the rest of the party has assembled in the church, Eomer and Beck
join them. They share their observations about the city and discuss
their next move. Skeeve notes that one of the guards in any group
always has a magical aura around him.

Thordek and Enoch will continue traveling together, sticking with the
cover story they developed. Beck suddenly announces that he also has a
cover story:

"I'm the new drunk in town. And I'm going to get started on my cover
story right now." He then marches over to the tavern and does exactly
that.

Skeeve takes a room. The rest of them secure rooms at the inn. As
evening draws in, they get meals and Thu'fir goes to the tavern to
keep an eye on Beck. He seems to be a quiet drunk and doesn't cause
any trouble.

They all have the first nice bed they have had in a long time. Thu'fir
wanders to the tavern and listens carefully, hearing nothing of
interest.

Enoch spends the evening working on translating his book. He manages
to translate the next section.

<div class="document">
**Part II: The Conquest of Mar Tesoro**

*Here the story of Thul Marblade continues. Several aspects of this
 tale are plainly ridiculous, while others simply stretch the
 imagination. It is, however, a fascinating piece of folklore.*

* Chronicler Norvus

Dwarven King Thul Marblade returned from Mt. Fiore and came again to
Ellas Morad, leader of the mountain Elves. This time asked for leave
to dig deep into the mountain and bring forth its treasure. He
promised to pay half of all that was mined in tribute.

But Morad forbade him saying, "Not if you were to surrender every gem
brought fourth to the light would I give you permission to do this,
for we Elves care not for gold or silver or for gems, but love only
our homeland. Our desire is not for wealth, but to live in a land
unspoiled."

Marblade became enraged, saying, "We offer to do all of the work, and
in return you will receive half of the profit. Never has a Dwarf made
such a generous offer! You find yourself atop a mountain of gold, and
your only thought is to use it as a garden, and will not let the
Dwarves even peer inside of it! It is unjust that the greatest of all
mountains should be in the hands of Elves, and not the Dwarves. If we
had the greatest of all woods in the world, surely we would share it
with the Elves, who love such things best. Therefore give us now leave
to mine the mountain."

Morad was unmoved, and did not see his peril. For he replied, "Nay!
You wish to barter with me a forest you do not own and have not seen,
against my home and the home of all my people? No! Cursed are you that
look on such a fair place and can think only of tearing it open to
find what is underneath. Depart from this land, and come never again
to the gentle slopes of Mt. Fiore!"

The Dwarf King's rage was now fully kindled, and he answered, "You bid
me, King of all the Dwarves, to depart from the king of all the
mountains? I will leave indeed, when I have all the treasure hidden
within. But you shall depart now!" And with that word he slew Morad
and all his men, for the Dwarves were strong and sturdy in battle and
the gentle Elves could make no contest against them.

Then the Dwarves roamed throughout the land, and killed every Elf they
could find. They hunted them like animals, killing even the youngest,
until not a single Elf drew breath in the land of Mar Tesoro. Their
bodies were thrown down the southern slope into the great chasm, which
is now called Bohrung Khel Toten, or "The Chasm of the Dead", in the
common tongue. And so were the fair mountain elves of Mar Tesoro
forever wiped from the face of the Earth.

Then Thul Marblade took for himself the mountain, and they renamed it
Khelberg, and they set to mine deep into the mountain and take its
treasures.

### 7th of Last Summer, 1501dy

It's morning. All were up late and trickle into the tavern around
nine. Beck is very hung over. Eomer explains what he saw. He wants
them to split up, try to get papers, try to find out about Endo. He
explains about the soldiers with the helmets and asks the cleric to
see what he can discover about them.

They break up to go to work, and Beck goes back to bed. Skeeve heads
to a tailor and requests a fancy robe with his insignia, trying to get
gossip in the meantime. His old robe is burned and damaged from acid,
and he needs to replace it. The shopkeeper is very free with the
gossip, telling Skeeve all sorts of gossip about people in the Bazaar,
but not relating anything interesting or useful to their quest.

The shopkeeper tells him that a 10% discount is available for members
of the mage's guild. Skeeve produces the membership they recovered
from Vormoth.

The tailor is very receptive but is disconcerted by the name on the
membership. He promises to have this ready as soon as possible. He is
suddenly going out of his way to get the order done quickly. He
promises the robe will be done by afternoon, not tomorrow as he said
earlier.

Skeeve is unnerved by this. He's worried that Vormoth is famous, and
the shopkeeper has spotted him as an impostor. Skeeve tips him 30g,
trying to get him not to say anything about who he is.

Skeeve leaves the shop and looks for a place where someone might be
interested in the staff. He finds a small place with lots of fancy
canes and sticks, most without magic. The large man behind the counter
is nodding a bit. Skeeve hands him the staff and he notices that this
is a Lormanite staff. He explains that the Lormanites (the wizards up
north) used to make staffs all pointy and evil like this. He pays 500
gold for it. As he is handed the money, Skeeve sees a shadow fall on
either side of him. The shop keeper backs away. Skeeve wonders who has
just stepped up behind him, but it must be someone imposing. Activity
has more or less stopped all around, and the usual chatter of the area
has stopped.

"Conjurer Vormoth", comes a voice of authority from behind him.

He slowly turns around and sees a huge group of soldiers. Two full
groups of soldiers (fourteen total) have spread themselves out behind
him. They stand in such a way that no fireball could hit more than
three of them and Skeeve could not draw a line from himself that
intersects with more than one soldier. Apparently these men are
familiar with fireballs and lightning bolts, and have dealt with
wizards before.

Nevertheless, the men look worried. They all have their hands on their
swords. Several of the younger men look like they may piss themselves.

Skeeve now realizes the shopkeeper didn't think he was a fake: These
people really do think he's Vormoth, and are treating him like a very
dangerous threat.

The commander speaks again, "Come now Vormoth. You don't want to start
trouble here with all of these people about. Be reasonable and come
along with us."

Skeeve waves his arm saying, "No, no, no. You misunderstand. I am not..."

As he waved his arm, the men flinch, as if expecting a blow. He can
see there is really no good way out of this, so he agrees to go with
them. They lead him (without laying a hand on him or disrespecting
him) over to the keep, and up to the magistrate on the second floor.

Magistrate Noreeno shuts the door behind him. The office of Magistrate
Noreeno is large and elegantly furnished. There is a large bookshelf
on one side of the room, filled with a variety of books. There is a
set of double doors, (which are open at the moment) which lead out
onto a balcony overlooking the merchant's square. Wind blows gently
in, stirring the curtains while voices from the square drift in from
below.

A stout cleric stand beside the desk, and two soldiers are posted in
the door, guarding the door. The other soldiers return to their
rounds, looking relieved.

Noreeno is surprised, "You are not conjurer Vormoth."

"No, I'm not", Skeeve admits.

The Magistrate rolls his eyes, "I just had a terrified shopkeeper in
here telling me stories about how he'd just seen Vormoth here in
town."

"Yes, I used his mage's guild membership. To get a discount."

"How did you come by the guild membership for Conjurer Vormoth?"

Skeeve shrugs, "Well, I killed him."

Noreeno is very impressed by this, "Killed him? I see. Well, well
done. I assume you're here for the reward?"

Skeeve pauses for a moment, and then answers, "Yes. That's why I'm
here."

Noreeno replies, "I see. Well, in that case I just need to ask you a
few questions. Just as a formality you understand. This won't take
long. So, while we talk, Galman is going to make sure neither of us
can tell a lie. Then I'm going to ask you some questions. "

Galman the Cleric casts Zone of Truth.

"First question. Now, I can tell the answer to this just by looking at
you, but I have to ask anyway: Are you with the northern army, the
Lormanites?"

"No."

"Of course not. Are you employed by them? Gathering information?
Mercenary? Spy?"

"Nope."

"Ever in the past?"

"No."

"I didn't think so. I just had to ask, you understand. Just routine.
Next question..."

"Okay."

"Ever killed any Alidian soldiers?"

> At this point everyone started laughing. Back in session one, they
> did in fact run into some soldiers and ended up killing them. Skeeve
> is in a Zone of Truth, and can't hide this. If he refuses to answer,
> Noreeno will realize the answer is "yes" anyway. He'd been pretty
> relaxed up until now. Now he realized he was in trouble.

"Um. Yes?"

Noreeno becomes very stern. The Soldiers at the door looked angry.
There is a long moment before Noreeno speaks again. He turns to the
soldiers at the door, "Gentlemen, would you please leave us alone for
now?"

The guards smile and leave. It is a safe guess that Noreeno is about
to dispense a little off-the-books justice and wants them out of the
room.

Once the door is shut Noreeno turns to Skeeve. "I don't care."

He elaborates, "It's a shame they heard you say that of course, but no
harm done. I don't care if you killed soldiers getting here. I'm sure
you didn't provoke them?"

"No."

"Of course not." At this point Noreeno has Skeeve tell about the
fight, how it started, and where it happened. He seems satisfied once
he's heard it. "This is not a big deal. Let's just continue with the
questions. How many people are you travelling with?"

Skeeve doesn't want to tell him, but he can't lie and doesn't want to
refuse to answer, "Six."

"Very good. You've done good work, and despite the unfortunate run-in
with our forces, you've done the Alidian army a great service. You're
entitle to the reward. You earned it."

Noreeno then hands Skeeve 2000g.

Noreeno then tells Skeeve that he is in charge of issuing Travel
Papers. He offers six sets of travel papers if Skeeve and his party
will do a job for him. He asks that Skeeve find his friends and bring
them in.

Skeeve agrees. They bid one another good day. As Skeeve leaves,
Noreeno calls in the captain. He gives instructions that Skeeve and
his friends are free to travel the city but they are not allowed to go
south.

Thordek and Enoch explore the square. They walk over to the south
gate, where the strange guards with the solid (eyeless) metal helmets
stand. Enoch cannot sense anything evil or demonic about them.

Thordek shops, looking for better armor in the square or anything else
he might find useful. He eventually orders a set of banded mail. They
don't have any ready to fit a Dwarf just now, but the smith can size a
set for him. It will be done in two days.

As he looks around the shops, he sees a great number of soldiers
assemble and lead Skeeve away, into the Keep.

Eomer goes shopping for the things he lost, including a lock-pick set
and a compass. He starts trying to gather information, specifically
about traveling papers.

Eomer ends up talking to a rough-looking guy at a "pawn" shop, who
also sells "used" (probably stolen) items along with handy "Locksmith
Tools". This guy is obviously connected to the criminal side of the
city. Eomer drops some coin and gets some information.

He learns that travel papers were instituted when northerners started
"leaking" in. Ever since Fort Bolland fell, people have been showing
up, telling various stories in an attempt to gain travel papers and go
south where they might cause trouble or simply flee the island. The
pawn shop owner "knows some guy" who can forge membership papers for
the Mage's Guild. This, Eomer gathers, is very difficult. Despite this
he's never made a counterfeit set of travel papers that worked.
Somehow the soldiers always spot the fakes, and nobody can figure out
how.

In the midst of discussing this he sees Skeeve pulled into the keep.

He also learns that papers are definitely needed for going south. If
he needs some, he could go to the magistrate, who has been known to
give foreigners travel papers. He also learns that in order to leave
this island they will need to reach the southernmost city, which is
the only major port still in operation. The other major port was Fort
Boland, which was recently conquered and isn't in any shape to engage
in any sort of commerce just yet.

Finally, Eomer learns the address of a contact on the northern side of
the city who is somehow connected with what is left of the resistance.

Once Skeeve emerges from the keep, the party (minus Beck) meets out
front. Skeeve explains what is going on, and also stops at the tailor
shop to see if the tailor was really making his robes.

Skeeve tries to convince them that the group should go see Noreeno
quickly. They head to the keep, leaving Beck to sleep.

They return to Noreeno's office. Noreeno introduces himself, and then
explains the Zone of Truth again. Glamn casts it, and Noreeno begins
his questions. He gets their names, makes sure they are not working
for the Lormanites, and gets some background.

Finally he offers them a chance to ask him some questions, under the
zone of truth.

Eomer asks Noreeno about his position as magistrate. The party has
sort of sensed that Noreeno's loyalties are a bit out of alignment
with the Alidians, and he seems to be willing to work against them.
Noreeno explains that he was appointed magistrate by the Queen when
the city fell a year ago.

"Queen who?", Thu'fir asks.

Noreeno is surprised, "Queen Alidia. Our leader. Anyway, she appointed
me to this position when we took over the city. I've run it since
then. I'm sure you've noticed that I have my own agenda. My loyalties
lie not with the Alidians or the Lormanites, but elsewhere. I have my
own goals, which is why I'm asking for the services of outsiders like
yourselves."

Eomer asks about Endo. Noreeno hasn't heard the name, but when Eomer
describes a large bald monk with tattoos on his chest Noreeno's eyes
light up. "So! You know him?"

Noreeno explains that yes, Endo was here. Endo was caught trying to
sneak around the town. They managed to capture him,but not until he
managed to kill several guards. He stood his ground so that his
companion might escape. Noreeno then asks the party who Endo was
traveling with.

When they explain that they don't know he is very irritated.

He then returns to the subject of the job he has for them. He can't
discuss the particulars of the job in town, but he admits that the job
is dangerous, but he wouldn't ask them to do it if he didn't think
they could pull it off. This job must be done by outsiders. In
exchange for this job, he offers them six sets of travel papers, a
membership to the Mage's Guild for Skeeve, and information on where
they can find Endo.

Eomer asks what Endo was trying to do. Noreen explains that he doesn't
know. He'd wanted to interrogate Endo himself, but the Alidian
soldiers took him south directly without giving Noreeno a chance to
intervene.

They talk a bit more. Eomer and Noreeno make another side deal: If
Eomer can find out who Endo's companion is, Noreeno will reveal how
they spot fake travel papers.

Noreeno reveals that he can't describe more about the job while in
town. He points out Vale Calma on their map, and gives them a location
where they should meet him, at dawn, in two days.

Eomer asks about the soldiers in masks. Noreeno replies that they are
the Queen's elite guard. They take orders from her only and he has no
idea how.

He then asks, "What is the Queen like"?

"She is quite vicious. Everybody who rules over this island has to be
vicious. Anyone who isn't, won't rule long."

They ask if it this job they have to do is immoral. Noreeno replies,
"It depends on who you ask. Certainly if you ask people in town they
will think it is immoral."

Thu'fir asks about horses. Noreeno says they are hard to come by, even
for him.

They bid each other good day and the party leaves.

Thordek returns to the smith and asks if he could have the armor done
tomorrow. He drops in an extra 46 gold and the smith promises it by
tomorrow noon.

As evening approaches, Eomer heads to the north side of town,
stealthily, to someone who is a member of the Lormanite resistance.
The place is in a shabby house, around the back, past the pigs, and
down the steps to the root cellar. A kid in his 20's seems to run the
place. He is scarred and shifty. He seems to be running a safe-house
of some sort, where fugitives from the north might hide. Eomer begins
bribing information out of him.

The kid talks a lot, lies a lot, is distrusting and untrustworthy.
Nevertheless, Eomer manages to drag a good deal of information from
him. He learns the following:

* The Monk (presumably Endo, although he never gave his name) was here
  a few days ago. He was with some skinny kid in his late teens. They
  hid for a day and headed south.
* Endo seemed to know all the passwords and locations of resistance
  members, even though he is a foreigner here, and isn't the sort to
  get involved in politics or wars like this.
* The location where they will meet Noreeno is known to have a lot of
  ruins.

Eomer returns to the Inn. They have a free day to spend in town, and
then they must head off to Vale Calma to meet with Magistrate Noreeno
and find out what job he has for them...

## Session 5

### 7th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Late Afternoon)

Enoch heads back to the Inn. He plans to spend the evening translating
another chapter of the old book they found. This takes about five
hours, at the end of which he has successfully translated the
following:

<div class="document">
**Part III: Spirit of Fiore**

*The previous section records the tale of Thul Marblade, how he
exterminated a supposedly idyllic race of mountain Elves and claimed
Khelberg as his own. This section attempts to gather together the
different accounts of Marblade's rule and form a single coherent tale.
The varying stories (mostly oral, as a rule) conflict in many ways but
all have a few common threads. Most importantly, the actions of the
"Spirit of the Mountain" are, in different accounts, attributed to
various gods and deities. Nevertheless, the underlying theme of
punishment and curse is present in all variants of the tale.*

*It is recorded here for those curious about ancient myths and
folklore. The reader should not view this as a work of history.*

â€“ Chronicler Norvus

Thul Marblade took the Elven lands of Mt. Fiore, destroyed the Elves
that dwelt therein, and renamed it Khelberg. Once all was under his
dominion, he sought the depths of the mountain.

Yet the Spirit of the Mountain, sometimes called Fiore, did not forget
the Elves, and greatly lamented their loss. So furious was the spirit
of Fiore that it decided that none of the plunderers would have the
wealth they sought. So it was that the mountain resisted the Dwarves,
and fought against them as they dug.

The Dwarves found that each new shaft led only to trouble or death.
Some caved in or flooded, others gave way suddenly, dropping the
diggers into bottomless black holes. Still others issued forth molten
rock which flowed from the holes like blood, filling them in and
killing many miners.

Despite their masterful skills at digging and the making of mines, the
Dwarves were defeated at every attempt. Many perished, and they were
dismayed, saying that they should leave the mountain be and seek
treasure where it may be less plentiful yet more easily obtained. They
grew to fear the mountain, and dared not walk on the slopes at night
when the land was restless and treacherous.

But Marblade was stubborn and would not turn away. He perceived the
Spirit and sought to contain it. He sent word to the many Dwarf-clans,
calling for the greatest wielders of magic and those with the
knowledge of the arcane, that they should come to Mt. Khelberg and aid
him in his war against Fiore. In exchange he offered all the gems that
the Dwarves had managed to wrest from the mines. Many answered his
call.

They met at the slopes of Khel Toten to gather their power together,
and bind the Spirit of the Mountain. Using both strength and sorcery,
both pick axe and spell-book, they drove a single deep shaft into the
heart of the mountain. The battle was terrible and numerous Dwarves
were killed in the making of it, but at last Marblade arrived in the
lowest depths of the Earth, and there he cast the great binding-spell
to forever contain Fiore.

Even as he did, the Spirit in turn cast one final curse: A voice came
from the Earth saying, "Even as you have cursed this land, so now will
the land curse you. All who dwell here are doomed to constant war. All
who attack the mountain are doomed to also defend it. Foes will come
from around the world to plunder this place, and those who gather my
riches will only live to see them scattered."

With that, Fiore was bound and silenced. The Dwarves sealed the tunnel
they had dug, and called it a tomb, for many had fallen in the making
of it.
</div>

While Enoch is doing this, the rest of the party heads for the tavern.
Eomer spends the evening chatting with the locals. He wants to know
what they will find at Vale Calma. His skill at adopting accents and
his general charm gets people to drop their guard and reveal a bit
more than the average outsider might glean, although he still doesn't
learn a great deal. It seems this area is covered in old ruins and is
the site of many old battles. The townies are a bit superstitious and
don't like talking about the dead. However, Eomer does learn that
probably heroes or champions from old wars are buried there. Perhaps a
destroyed town? Stories conflict. It seems that the island of Mar
Tesaro has seen a great deal of war over the centuries and the map has
changed a lot. Towns have risen, some were destroyed, and everyone
seems to have a different take on the old stories and legends.

Beck arrives much later in the evening and the rest of the party tell
him about the job they have with Magistrate Noreeno. After he gets a
few mugs into him, Beck opens up to them, and makes a little speech.

"Fellas, I'm glad we could travel together over the past week, but
it's time we parted ways. I've been in my share of scrapes over the
years, and I like to think I can take care of myself, but you guys are
something else. You seem to have a taste for danger. I just can't keep
up with you. I'm just a simple old sailor and travelling with you will
be the death of me. "

He then reminds them that he lost just about everyone he knew when the
ship went down. All he has left is a pregnant girl back in Bayhaven,
and his whole goal is to raise enough money to get back there and
settle down with her. He struggles a bit more, and then takes off his
hat, "You know I'm proud and I don't like asking for things. This is a
bit hard for me. But if you fellas would like to donte a few coins to
help out I'd appreciate it. I'm not asking' for me, I'm asking' for
Talla and the baby."

Skeeve and Eomer make no comment, but Thordek drops 150g into Beck's
hat. Thu'fir gives 200g, and finally Enoch the Cleric gives an
astounding 700g to him. Beck is moved by this. He thanks them. He
tells them his plan is to get some conventional job in town and see if
he can earn some travel papers in some other way. He'll then travel
south and leave the island on his own. It might take him longer this
way, but it will be safer and he has Talla and the baby to think of
now.

They finish their drinks and head off for bed at the Inn.

### 8th of Last Summer, 1501dy

They party begins the day by getting ready for their trip tomorrow.
Skeeve now has a membership to the mage's guild, which means he can
shop at some of the more exclusive places in town. He buys some
potions. He purchases a potion of healing, which he presents to
Thordek as thanks for saving his life a few days earlier. Thordek is
grateful, although Skeeve's begrudging manner does little to improve
Elven / Dwarven relations.

Thordek picks up his new banded mail and sells off the old. Eomer gets
himself some various useful tools.

Skeeve find a place with various maps for sale, and buys a map of the
entire island:

![](images/map_mar_tesaro.gif)

Enoch spends the day in his room, translating the book. He has a
little success and translates the following:

<div class="document">
**Part IV: The First Uprising**

*While other stories in this volume are little more than folklore, the
following is very probably a true account. The events outlined here
are supported by various other trustworthy documents. (See also:
"Reign of King Oemar Vol III" and "The First Uprising of Khelberg")*

â€“ Chronicler Norvus

The Dwarven King Marblade began a great dig within the gem-filled
mountain of Khelberg. Several shafts were dug and many heaps of
treasure brought into the world. Yet in the forty-second year of his
reign over Khelberg, Elves came from out of the east. Some came from
Dunlock and some from more distant lands. They swept through the
country and drove the Dwarves away. The Dwarves were slow to
relinquish their prize, and most were wiped out. The few who escaped
were scattered and weakened, and would not return to Khelberg in their
lifetimes.

The Elves claimed the mountain, saying it was the rightful property of
their people, and just reparations for the crimes against their slain
kin. Yet they kept the name Khelberg, and sought to continue the
plunder begun by the Dwarves. They hired many Humans and Halflings as
diggers, and sent them into the Dwarven mines. While these new races
had less skill at such work than those that first created the mines,
they were eager and learned much as they examined the Dwarven
handiwork. In several years' time, the mountain flowed with gems and
precious metal such as had never been seen by mortals. The Elves
became among the richest in the world, and their empire grew.

They expanded the number of mines, until the face of the mountain
looked like a great hive. The mountain slopes became gray and lifeless
as the trees and grass were stripped away to make room for more
digging.

More workers of varying races were brought to the mines. Some were
Orcish or Goblin slaves, who were sent to do the most dangerous or
back-breaking labor. Others were Elves who were guilty of some crime
according to Elven law, and had been sentenced to work within the
mountain as punishment. Some were also of Halfling and Gnomish kind,
although their numbers were always few. Of all the workers, humans
were both the most numerous and useful. They were intelligent and
strong, and did not hate the underworld as the Elves and Gnomes do.
They came closest to the skill of the Dwarves in mine-work, and ever
they strove greedily for the richest loads.

Yet less than a single generation later, the workers began to resent
their place in the world. They noticed that the work was theirs, while
the riches were not. A Human rose from among the workers and led them
in rebellion. Lorman was his name, and he was both a cunning general
and a powerful wizard. They overthrew their Elven employers, slaying
many Elves and at last taking the land as their own. During this time,
many Orcs and Goblins escaped and fled north where they would later
multiply and grow strong.

The war was long and bloody, and many lives were lost on both sides.
When at last the battle ended, Lorman was crowned their king. Once
again the Elves had been banished from the mountain.
</div>

That afternoon they regroup. Enoch shows the others what he's
translated. Then they discuss their plans for the upcoming job. None
of them really trust Noreeno. They were instructed to meet Noreeno at
dawn tomorrow. They would like a bit more information going in.

Vale Calma is about three hours away on foot. They decide that Eomer
will leave at midnight, which will bring him to the valley at around
3am. He will go and spy out the meeting site ahead of time to see if
Noreeno is planning some sort of ambush. The others will leave later,
and will arrive at dawn according to the agreement.

Since they will be getting up very early, they head right to bed to
get what rest they can.

### 9th of Last Summer, 1501dy

In the early hours of the morning Eomer arrives at the field where
they are to meet Noreeno at dawn. It is empty. He conceals himself in
the bushes at the edge of the field and waits.

After a while he hears some noises in the distance. It could be
voices. He moves on carefully, proceeding further into the valley.

Just over a small hill he sees men working. They have a team of four
horses and are pulling a massive stone slab. There is shouting and
cursing as they struggle with the horses and the ropes that tie them
to the stone. As the slab moves, Eomer can see that it is really a
lid, covering a long-sealed tomb. Noreeno stands by, overseeing the
operation. Eomer remains well hidden beyond the reach of their
torchlight.

At last the lid is removed, and some of the men set to taking care of
the horses. They remove the pulling harnesses and saddle them for
riding. Other men descend the steps. The sounds of metal striking
stone can be heard. It is unclear what they might be doing.

The soldiers regroup. All of this has taken a couple of hours, and now
dawn is near. The men ride out, past Eomer (who is still hiding)
towards the meeting field.

As dawn comes the other members of the party arrive in the field to
meet Noreeno and his men. Eomer sneaks up behind him and then joins
his friends.

### 9th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Early Morning)

The party stands with Noreeno and his men in the grassy fields of Vale
Calma.

They explain that Beck will not be joining them, and that he has moved
on. Noreeno explains that he knows, Beck visited him earlier today and
appealed to him for travel papers. They will come to some other
arrangement.

Once everyone is satisfied, Noreeno relates the details of the job he
has for them, "Do not speak of this job in town. The people are very
superstitious. If they found you have been here disturbing the tombs
they will not be happy. Furthermore, I won't be able to keep my end of
the bargain if you get people riled up. Keep this secret and we can
both get what we want. I need you to seek the deepest chamber and find
a sphere inside. I don't know what it looks like, but I'm sure you'll
know it when you see it. I want you to get it and bring it back. Any
other loot you find is yours to leave or keep as you choose."

Noreeno then brings out a necklace, affixed with a large gem. When
worn, it seems to give off a warm glow. He explains that the gem gives
off light according to the sun. At night, it gives no light. During
the day it glows yellow, at sundown it glows red, etc. He explains, "I
will give you this necklace that will glow while the sun is up. You
must go in during the day. If evening comes, and you are still inside,
I beg to to come back out and rest. DO NOT rest inside. Do not linger
inside at night. If night draws near, escape to the surface and try
again after the next sunrise. This is a tomb, after all. I don't know
what you'll find inside. I have no map and no advice to give. I'm sure
its dangerous, but I'm sure you figured that out already."

The details thus revealed, he asks the party, "So, are we agreed?"

They confer together. They do not trust him, but they also want the
travel papers and they want the information on where they can find
their friend Endo.

Skeeve negotiates for the soldiers tents and food rations so they have
everything they need for a camp. Noreeno has his men drop their tents
and food where they stand, letting the party claim whatever they find
useful. They can come out here and make camp at night if they feel the
need.

Satisfied, at last the party agrees to do the job.

Noreeno seems satisfied. He moves onto how they will meet when the
deal is through, "I can't personally wait for you here. I do have a
city to run. I will be back at sundown to meet you. If you are not
here, I will come back at sundown the next day, and the day after. If
I don't see you after three sundowns I'll assume you perished and we
will have to put the lid back on the tomb to keep anything from
escaping. This is not personal, please don't be offended. I have a
city to protect and we can't leave this thing open forever."

The party agrees that this is reasonable.

Noreeno bids them good-bye, "I'll be back with your payment at
sundown. You bring me what I want, and I'll bring you the items we
agreed on. Good luck."

Everybody prepares to go in. As Noreeno rides off to town, they make
their way over to the ruins.

A set of smooth stone steps goes down into the earth. There is a
massive slab of stone to one side, which clearly went over the steps,
but has now been pulled off. The exacting stonework reveal this place
to be of expert craftsmanship. Perhaps it is of Dwarven make, or
simply a very skilled stone-wright. Even after many centuries, the
gaps between the stones is so slight that the walls are most certainly
water tight, and there is a good chance the place could be airtight as
well. The door at the base of the steps is fifteen feet wide and six
feet high. It looks like a slab of solid stone. There are many
writings and symbols all around and the door way has a huge lock in
the center and many chisel marks all around. They cannot see which way
the door opens. From here it looks like a solid stone wall. There is
an ornate fixture in the center of this door. It is made from finely
crafted metal, and surrounds a round hole about the width of a hand.
This seems to be some sort of keyhole.

After Eomer attempts to pick the lock a handle suddenly comes out of
the wall. The handle is very ornate. It is made from finely crafted
metal, laced with intricate patterns of gold and silver. A lone
gemstone is inset into one end. Eomer pulls the handle and the 15 foot
door suddenly drops into the floor with a giant "Boom!" The way is now
open.

The top edge of the door is now flush with the floor. There is no
handle or any thing they might grasp, even if they could lift such a
weight. They observe that there is no way to seal the tomb now that it
is open.

Stale air flows from the dark chamber beyond. It is obvious the party
will be the first to venture inside since it was sealed. They decide
to hold onto the elaborately ornate handle. Eomer turns to everyone
and reminds them, "Don't touch nothing!" Thordek says he is not
leaving here with nothing so Eomer gives him the handle.

Open stone room. Even the slightest footstep seems to travel down the
corridors and come back to them as a dreary echo. Aside from the tiny
amount of daylight that reaches in from the open door to the south,
the place is utterly dark. There are four holes in the for, one in
each corner of the room. There is a stack of metal torch-poles leaning
in the south-east corner. There are open corridors to the east and
west, and another massive stone slab doorway to the north.

They light some of the torches in the room.

This is a strange sort of tomb. There are no family markers or names
engraved anywhere. There are no internment chambers to be seen. The
walls don't have any markings as one might expect in a typical burial
chamber.

The stone door ahead is a featureless, smooth stone slab. Definitely
undisturbed.

Afternoon arrives and the party has overcome a number of complex doors
and traps. They find themselves in a large chamber with a curved north
wall, covered in runes and various Human, Dwarven, and Elven names.
Among the names they spot the name "Forwinol", the last name of their
friend and ally Sagemaster Teerin Forwinol. They know he is quite old,
and wonder if he was involved in the building of this place.

They proceed deeper. Hours pass and they overcome more strange locking
mechanisms.

At last they come to a great chamber. It has a long walkway of
polished stone, like marble, leading from the door to the western side
of the room. Pillars line the north and south walls. The room is
unnaturally cold. The air is stagnant.

On the far western side of the hall is a raised Dias of pure white
stone, which holds a single black coffin. It is chained shut with many
(magical) chains and padlocks. It is on a tilted surface, leaning back
at a forty-five degree angle. In the center of the lid is a single
stone sphere, about the size of a grapefruit. It radiates both good
and evil. It pulses with magical energy. This is clearly their goal.

Several trays of gold coins are arranged around the Dias. A few gems
are scattered in with them as well. Thordek dumps these items into his
pack.

Skeeve and Eomer approach the coffin. Everyone else stands back.
Skeeve explains that he suspects that the magical sphere probably
keeps the chains locked. They all suspect that taking the sphere will
open all of the coffins they have passed. They talk about what kind of
dangers they might face.

From their view, the tomb is divided into two areas. There are the
outer chambers, which are just a few rooms. Then there is the inner
chambers, which is everything else. Between these two sections is a
single massive door that they can open and shut.

Their plan is that the entire party will wait near the door. Skeeve
will stand away from the coffin, at a distance, and use his magic to
quickly pull the sphere away and over to where he is standing, and
then they will all dash for the entrance. Once they reach the outer
chamber, they will shut the large door and hopefully seal these dozens
of coffins inside once again. There are only three coffins in the
outer chamber. Once the door is shut, they will visit the side-chamber
with these coffins and see if they are open and, if so, what is in
them.

They get into positions. They count to three, and Skeeve uses his
magic. Skeeve finds his magic does not affect the sphere. Reluctantly,
he walks over and grasps the sphere. It pulls free. Suddenly the
chains break free and drop to the floor, just as they feared. They
don't even wait to see what happens, they just dash. As they run away,
they hear a great echo throughout the chamber, the sound of someone
drawing in a deep breath. There is a pause and the breath is let out
once again, like a great sigh. They keep running.

They pass many coffins on their way out. As they feared, the locks
have fallen off, and the chains now hang freely from the walls. The
coffins remain closed, but they are no longer locked shut.

They reach the outer chamber and â€“ after some messing around with
switches â€“ manage to close the door again. Before they leave, they
visit the side chamber and examine the three remaining coffins.

The chains have indeed fallen off. They take positions around the
coffin. Everyone gets ready.

Thu'fir pulls the lid away. The coffin is empty. The move onto the
next one. Again the lid is pulled away, only this time the coffin is
occupied.

![](images/grave_walker.jpg)

The creature moves with inhuman speed and grace. It darts among them
during the battle. While clearly undead, it is not a shambling,
rotting zombie. Instead of a flimsy corpse, the thing is tough and
hard. A dim red light comes from deep within the eye sockets.

The party was well-prepared, and they manage to bring the beast down
after a short battle.

The next coffin has another. In this battle, Enoch gets stabbed by the
cold, piercing claws and finds himself unable to move. Thu'fir brings
his massive sword down and cleaves the thing in two. They take a deep
breath. What were these things? They were too meaty to be skeletons,
and much too fast to be zombies. They have never faced anything like
this.

The mystery will have to wait. They escape to the surface and find
themselves in the warm glow of late afternoon. All is quiet behind
them, and the door to the inner chambers has remained closed. Enoch
consecrates the area around the entrance, hoping that will prevent or
impede anything that might follow. He then sees to the wounded and
heals their injuries.

Evening is coming. Noreeno will probably arrive in an hour or so,
assuming he keeps his end of the deal.

Eomer is concerned that Noreeno will betray them. Now that they have
the sphere, Noreeno could simply have his soldiers kill the party and
take it. Eomer suggests that they claim they don't yet have the item.
Once Noreeno leaves, they can slip into town and meet him in public
the next day, where they can be sure he won't try to double-cross
them.

Enoch points out that his cleric may use Zone of Truth again. This
would prevent them from lying about recovering the sphere. They
discuss this at length. Eventually, Eomer devises the following:

*Skeeve and Thordek will go back inside with the sphere and stand in
one of the outer chambers. When Noreeno asks where the sphere is,
Eomer will be able to (truthfully) reply that it is still inside. He
will also be able to say that the others are inside. Since he won't
know what chamber they are in, he can also say he doesn't know **where
they are**. This will hopefully be misleading enough to satisfy
Noreeno and persuade him to leave.*

During this conversation, Skeeve has been studying the sphere. He has
more bad news for the party. He has discovered what this sphere is.

<div class="document">
**Orb of Mordan**

A 7 lbs. orb of polished stone with many strange runes engraved into
it. It is a little bigger than a closed human fist. Lawful Good and
Lawful Evil characters may not use or study this item.

"Grants" -3 HP, +3MP to the owner of this object.

This object is the phylactery for Mordan the Lich King. Normally this
is the container of the Lich's life force. As long as a lich's
phylactery reamins intact, they will rise again after being defeated.
However, this orb seems to have a number of (sometimes conflicting)
enchantments which suggest it is more than a "normal" phylactery.

The surface of the orb is covered in many arcane runes and symbols.
They are in draconic, infernal, and celestial. Words and phrases
intersect in complex ways to form layers of spells and secrets.

The orb seems to drain a bit of life from the owner, resulting in
-3HP, while at the same time placing them more in tune to the world of
magic. This results in +3MP while they remain the owner of the object.
This only applies to users of arcane magic (Wizards, Sorcerers) and
not clerics.

The runes and spells contain a great deal of knowldege. It must be
studied to learn more. When examining the orb, it is clear there are
four categories of study that are possible: Good, Ownership, Knowledge
Evil.

At the outset, it will take only 1 hour of study to attempt to gain a
level (and thus earn some knowledge) in a particular area. If you
succeed, it will take 2 hours of time to attempt again in the same
area of study. So, the length of time required for each attempt is the
current level x 1 hour.

To study the orb:

1. First, announce which area you plan to study from the four above.
2. Roll d20
3. Add your INT modifier
4. Add +1 for all of the following languages you know: draconic,
   infernal, and celestial.
5. If your roll is high enough, you will learn more about your chosen
   area.

Each level of study will become more difficult as you progress.
</div>

This is the phylactery of a Lich named Mordan. It is (for some reason)
infused with both good and evil magic. The object has an owner. To
learn more about how this works, he will need to study the object in
depth.

They party is shocked. What have they just done? It seems they have
somehow freed or awoken a Lich. Does Noreeno even know what this thing
is?

They have an hour until Noreeno arrives. Skeeve spends this hour
studying the orb, examining the runes and trying to learn its spells
and mysteries. He learns the following:

![](images/orb_o1.gif)

They no longer want to turn this orb over to Noreeno. This is much
bigger and more dangerous than they imagined.

They get into their agreed positions, and wait.

### 9th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Near Sunset)

At last, as the sun drops to the horizon and sunset approaches,
Noreeno arrives. He and a force of ten soldiers arrive at the opposite
side of the field. The soldiers stop and dismount. Noreeno and his
cleric ride out alone to meet Eomer, Enoch, and Thu'fir.

As they feared, Galman the cleric casts Zone of Truth over the meeting
place. None of them may speak any lies now. There is a pause as
Noreeno looks to the east, towards the tomb. After a pause he seems
satisfied, "Good, I can tell you have released Mordan. Well done."

They pepper him with questions. *How do you know Mordan is free? What
are you doing this for? Why did you want him freed?* Noreeno finally
holds up a hand and answers, "I do not intend to reveal my true goal
and nature to you, but I will tell you that this is the culmination of
a plan begun by others, over a century ago. It wasn't until now, with
the confusion of the war, a populace that has mostly forgotten what
was buried here, being in a place of power close to Mordan's prison,
and the right group of outsiders who were willing to do this. Many
long years of careful planning have led to this moment."

Eomer informs him they they will not give him the Orb. Noreeno laughs,
"Oh! I don't want it. All I wanted was for you to free Mordan. You can
deal with the orb yourself." He smiles. Eomer is boiling with rage.

The party is enraged and horrified as this. Noreeno is calm, and
continues, "I realize you are upset. I want to warn you: At sundown
Mordan will emerge from his prison. I assure you, you don't want to be
here when he does. He will be seeking you. Yes. He will be hunting for
all of you now. I'm sorry for the way things turned out, but I do
intend to keep my part of the bargain."

He produces five sets of travel papers and holds them up, "Here are
the papers, as promised. I will give you your papers, and what's more,
I'll give you three horses to ride out of here. But only if you agree
to leave quietly. If you want to make a scene or unpleasantness, then
I warn you: The battle would simply delay you, keeping you here until
Mordan emerges. You don't want that."

> The players were delighted (at the plot twist) and enraged (at
> Noreeno). They couldn't fight him and all of his soldiers, and even
> if they somehow won, it would just mean they would find themselves
> spent and injured when the Lich emerges. They realized they were
> more or less screwed at this point and couldn't do anything but let
> Noreeno have his way.

They are silent for several moments. "What about Endo?", Eomer demands
at last.

Noreeno nods, "Your companion, as I said, was captured and taken
south. However, my spies report that he was not sent to work in the
mines, but instead was turned into on of the Queen's special guard.
You remember the soldiers with the faceless helmets, with no eye
holes? Well, he is one of them now. He will probably notbe in the
capital city of Fol Theron, but instead will be in on of the smaller
towns between there and here. You'll have to look for him. "

The party listens carefully as Noreeno explains, "Few know this, but
the soldiers are controlled through the helmets. You can't see it, but
below the bottom edge of the helmet, just under the chin, is a leather
strap holding the helmet in place. Cut it and pull off the helmet, and
your friend will be freed."

The sun is setting soon, but Eomer can't resist one more question,
"What about the travel papers? How do the soldiers always know they
are fake?"

Noreeno smiles, "Because we ask them. Even if the forgery is a
complete success and is good enough to fool the soldiers, we simply
ask the person holding the papers. You know how fond I am of Zone of
Truth. Those that have fakes are arrested and never get the chance to
explain how they were caught. Up until now the forgers have always
assumed they were doing something wrong, or missing some hidden
detail. The truth is, the only way someone can use a fake is if they
don't **know** it's a fake."

All of them want to know what cause they just served, and who Noreeno
is working for. He answers, "There are two powers you have seen. To
the north are the now-defeated Lormanites. To the south are the
Alidians. You have just aided a third power. A rising power. You may
learn more soon, but now is not the time."

Noreeno looks at the setting sun, "It's time to go gentlemen. If you
agree to leave quietly you can have the travel papers and the horses.
What do you say?"

They cannot lie in the zone of truth. They cannot hope to beat Noreeno
and his men. They cannot linger here or they will have to face the
Lich. Angry and beaten, they agree to leave in peace. Before they go,
Eomer makes Noreeno a promise, "Someday, I **will** kill you."

"Fair enough", Noreeno smiles, "But not today."

They take the horses and flee. As they ride away from the crypt, Enoch
can see a dark aura of evil engulfing the site. They head south, back
to Crossway. As they ride they discuss their next move. They don't
want to to linger in Crossway. They have no idea what Mordan the Lich
will do when he comes out, or what Noreeno is really doing. Eomer
suggests that perhaps this third force is the cause of the mountain
itself? Of Fiore? They have only just read the account of the conquest
of the mountain the day before. The book warned that the tale was
merely folklore, but they all suspect there is more to it than just a
legend.

They want to ask help of Sagemaster, but they can't reach him.

Eomer points out that Noreeno is obviously an enemy of Queen Alidia.
They have heard that she is cold and ruthless, but she might still be
an ally against the Lich. Eomer proposes they head to town and find
one of her special guards and tell him what has happened. Since she
seems to connect with them through magic, she ought to know quickly.

As they ride south, they decide they need to rescue Beck from the
town. It is probably no longer safe in Crossway. During the ride,
Skeeve studies the Orb some more. He learns:

![](images/orb_k1.gif)

This doesn't help him very much, but he does gain some knowledge
that will help him in future study attempts.

> I won't get into all of the rules of this little mini-game. This
> basically means all future study rolls get +1.

They arrive in Crossway. It is well past dark now. They ride to the
south gate to find the special guards, but find only evidence of
battle. The royal guards are gone. They have either fled the city or
have been slain by men loyal to Noreeno. The Queen no longer has any
royal guards here in Crossway. Could she know already? They are even
more convinced that some sort of power struggle is going on, and they
must get Beck out of the city as soon as possible.

Beck is not in the tavern as they suspected. Instead, they find him at
the Inn. He answers the door in his skivvies, obviously already in
bed. He squints in the torchlight as they try to explain that he needs
to leave.

He shakes his head, "No more adventures, boys. I got myself a job
hauling goods around for a shop and I start tomorrow, I need some
sleep..."

Skeeve cuts him off and explains that he has to leave, and the city is
no longer safe for him. They relate a few of the events that have
happened. Convinced, Beck runs inside to get ready to travel.

The six of them get on their three horses and ride south out of town
as if the devil himself pursued them. They are tired. They have had
only a few hours of sleep over the last few days, but they want to put
some distance between themselves and the city before they can consider
rest.

## Session 6

### 9th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Night)

Everyone is very tired. Eomer most of all. They left the city of
Crossway about a half an hour ago and have been riding south at a
steady pace since then. At last they halt and discuss their next move.

Eomer wants to split the party up, sending Enoch and Skeeve back north
to the library in Breakshore while the rest of them head south and
locate Endo. Beck doesn't like this plan. There is a heated debate.

They decide to stay together for now and ride south to the next town.
They recall that Noreeno said they would find Endo in one of the towns
between the rivers. This means there are four towns where he may be
found. Perhaps they can learn a bit more and then have a better idea
of what they should do next. They review the map...

![](images/map_mar_tesaro.gif)

...and decide to head for the town marked "Dockhouse". A little after
midnight they have to ride over an arching bridge, taking them into
Central Mar Tesaro.

### 10th of Last Summer, 1501dy

At about 2:30 am they come to Dockhouse. The entire "town" is a
collection of four buildings. Down by the lakeshore there is a
Dockhouse where a large ferry sits quietly in the water. There are two
other houses and some stables. The entire population of the town is
doubtless less than two dozen. The town seems to exists simply to care
for the ferry.

An Alidian solder is here. He has left off most of the standard
uniform and is only wearing the red and white shirt. He is standing by
the well, holding a lantern. He looks relaxed. This town obviously
sees little in the way of excitment. The guard hails them as they
approach and examines their travel papers. Once he's satisfied, they
learn that the basement of the largest house serves as a flophouse
where they may spend the night. There is also a small stable available
for the horses. They drop a few coins to secure the services they
need, and then head to bed.

The flophouse is a crowded room with hard, military-style cots along
the wall. There are beds for eight, although they are the only ones
here tonight. The place is dusty and shabby. They tumble into the beds
and begin to sleep. However, Skeeve decides to stay up an hour and
work on his orb. He studies, but is very tired and has a rough time of
it. Nevertheless, he does meet with some success and learns more about
ownership.

![](images/orb_o2.gif)

They sleep all night and well into the morning. By noon they are up
and wondering what to do next. They elect to spend the day here so
that Enoch and Skeeve can study some more. The others spend the day
outside. They feel safe in this quiet, out-of-the-way little town.
Eomer suggests that they make an effort to move around in secret,
traveling by night and sleeping by day. The others agree. In the
meantime, Skeeve has some more success with his studies:

![](images/orb_o3.gif)

Night falls. As Enoch and Skeeve complete their studies they hear
yelling outside. The party dashes outside.

In the center of town they see a hideous beast looks like an undead
human. However, instead of moving zombie-like, it seems to move with
inhuman speed and grace. The eyes give off a dim red light. It is
dressed in flowing black rags. The body is dried out and wiry, but
isn't falling apart. It looks tough and hard. As the run from the
basement into the moonlight, they see the beast is throttling the
guard. Eomer concludes that it is after Skeeve. He orders that Enoch
and Skeeve make for the stables and try to escape while the rest of
the party deals with it. It is fast, but they doubt it can keep0 up
with a horse.

The creature tosses the body of the guard to one side and heads
directly for Skeeve. It moves to cut off his escape. The battle is
joined.

Their blades flash in the moonlight as they fight. It is terrifyingly
fast, but they overcome it with their numbers and fell the beast.
Skeeve suggests they break its head to make sure it doesn't rise
again. Enoch decides to check on the guard and see if there is any way
to help him. To his surprise, the guard is on his feet, walking
towards him.

"Need help? You ok?", Enoch asks.

The guard doesn't respond. He is pale and silent as he makes his way
over to Enoch.

Thu'fir rolls his eyes. He can see where this is going, and he knows
its going to end badly.

Enoch tries again to address the guard but is attacked. He is clearly
undead. Thu'fir dispatches him easily.

The Dock wardend emerge from their homes to see the aftermath. There
is a very akward conversation as they explain why Thu'fir was killing
the town guard. Things are tense for a few minutes until everything is
explained.

The party realizes that Mordan must know where they are. They are
placing this village in danger by staying. They decide to leave now.
It is only an hour or so after sunset, and they should be able to
cover some distance tonight if they depart quickly. The townspeople
make it more or less clear that the party has worn out their welcome.
They understand why their friend was killed, but there seem to be some
hard feelings that would be best healed by distance.

They head north, out of town. Tal Podere seems to be the next closest
town, so they head in that direction...

### 11th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Midnight)

They travel west, heading for the town of Tal Podere. As morning draws
near, they pass a number of the Queen's elite guards walking along the
road in the opposite direction.

They have never seen the guards from this close. The helmets completly
cover their heads, giving them no way to see out. Each helmet has the
symbol of the Alidian army stamped on the front, where the wearer's
face would be:

![](images/flag.gif)

Clearly the helmets are magical, although perhaps the men that wear
them are magical as well. They never seem to get tired or need rest.

The party has discussed these soldiers before. Noreeno implied that
these soldiers somehow communicated with the Queen. The soldiers
themselves seem a bit mindless. They never speak. How does she control
them? Telepathy? Mind control? That have no idea. However, there does
seem to be some connection. Perhaps they can use these soldiers to
communicate with the Queen and let her know about Mordan.

Eomer yells at them to stop. They ignore him. He gets down from his
horse and stands in their path as they march. The leader reaches for
his sword. Eomer holds up his hands in a peaceful gesture, which is
ignored. He holds his ground and tries to engage the soldier in
conversation. The sword is drawn. Eomer backs out of its way. The
sword returns to his side.

Eomer gives up and simply jogs alongside them (they march very fast)
as he talks. He tells them that Mordan is free and that Noreeno seems
to be some sort of betrayer. He relates the important points of the
last few days. The solders never acknowledge him in any way.

Shrugging, he returns to the others. He's done what he could to let
the Queen know. They have no idea if it worked or not.

They reach the city in late morning. Tal Podere is a medium city, less
than half the size of crossway. The buildings are low and made of
wood. There is very little stonework here in town. Most of the
buildings are built along a single street, which is wide and filled
with ruts. (To modern eyes, this town would look vaguely old-west â€“
Shamus) It has a wide open area around the well in the center of town.
The gates are manned by conventional guards; no elite guards are to be
seen.

They are pulled over at the gate, and their papers are inspected. Once
everything is settled, the enter the city.

They are sent to the Magistrate. Magistrate K'dar Stonefist is a wise
old Dwarf. Once the party has gethered before him, he informs them
that he has a notice from Magistrate Noreeno, warning him that five
outsiders had killed a number of his soldiers and stolen some horses.
Noreeno also suggested in his letter that these men were Lormanites,
and that they should be killed on sight.

The party is furious. There seems to be no end to Noreeno's trechery.

Stonefist seems unsurprised. He then demands they give an account of
themselves. Eomer relates the events of the past few days. The
magistrate doesn't seem to doubt his story at all. Once complete,
Stonefist reveals that Noreeno has been distrusted for a long time
among the other town leaders.

Eomer asks him about the soldiers they found traveling north.
Stonefist explains that they left here yesterday. He doesn't control
them directly, of course. They obey the mysterious will of the Queen
from afar. As the Magistrate, he can sometimes get the elite guards to
obey simple orders, but mostly they come and go according to her will.
He expects she is moving troops around, and that they will get more
elite guards soon; she never leaves the town without her own guards
for long.

Stonefist pronounces them innocent of any wrongdoing, and invites them
to make themselves at home in his town. They party bids him good-day
and retires to the inn. Later in the day, a note is delivered to
Thordek that invites him back to the magistrate's office.

Thordek visits K'dar Stonefist in his office. The two Dwarves begin by
speaking of Dwarven things: Where they are from and who they are
related to. They discuss stonework and family trees for some time
before K'dar turns the conversation to business.

Back at the inn, Skeeve studies the orb and learns the following:

![](images/orb_g2.gif)

That afternoon, the party members are summoned back to the
Magistrate's office to attend a town council that has been called.
Many of the town leaders have gathered here, and Stonefist wants
everyone to hear what Eomer told him earlier.

K'dar does not trust the cleric magic and zone of truth. Noreeno used
it often and it seemed to be a tool to mislead. K'dar prefers they
speak plainly of their business. He will trust the words of another
dwarf.

Once the story of Noreeno is finished, the town leaders comment. It
seems the name of Mordan is mostly legend, and much of his history has
been forgotten. He has become a story to scare children at night, and
much of his tale has been twisted. Some tales remember him as a
Vampire King, and others as a man who was half-dragon, or half-devil,
or any other of a number of variants on the tale.

K'dar has not trusted Noreeno in months. Noreeno has been claiming the
resistance has been harassing his borders, taking food and supplies.
Over the past few months, he has constantly requested more food, man,
and supplies. A month ago, K'dar sent one of his own men to visit the
city under the guise of a merchant courrier. He reported the city was
secure, and the soldiers he had amassed were guarding the city and not
searching the countryside for Lormanites.

Noreeno has been moving troops around in odd ways. He sends back some
divisions saying they "lack dicipline". The men are fine and fit.
K'dar suspects their loyalties are not as flexible enough to suit
Noreeno.

Eomer tells him that Noreeno killed their four elite soldiers.
Stonefist is not surprised and mentions that same night his four gate
soldiers left.

At this point a town guard stepps into the room and informs the
Magistrate that a set of four new elite solders have just arrived and
are now guarding the gates of the city.

Eomer immediately leaves.

Outside, it is sunset. The four new royal soldiers have taken their
place at the north side of town. The uniform of the elite soldiers is
simple: They wear the metal helmets and black pants. They are
bare-chested and carry a single broadsword at their side. Eomer draws
near to the guards and sees that one of them has tatoos on his chest.
It is Endo.

Eomer waves at him but gets no response.

He goes back into the meeting, where the town members are still
arguing about the veracity of the various legends of Mordan. Eomer
whispers to the group that he has found Endo.

They decide to talk to the magistrate after everyone leaves. Thordek
will do the talking.

The meeting ends and everyone heads home. Thordek asks the magistrate
for help in recovering their friend.

K'dar replies, "It is treason for me to harm these guards. However, I
can command the soldiers to do simple things. If you like, I can order
him to patrol north of the city. Perhaps you can catch him alone. You
can do as you will then. I doubt he will be missed in the confusion
with Noreeno. Don't tell me anymore about it. Agreed?"

They retire to the inn. The casters go study. Fifteen minutes later
there is much yelling and shouting. Eomer sees the guards attacking a
creature trying to slink into town. K'dar comes out and checks on
things and sees that all is well.

Skeeve and Enoch continue to study. Skeeve learns what happens when
the sphere is destroyed.

![](images/orb_e2.gif)

This at least explains why nobody has destroyed the orb. He also
learns that Mordan will appear back at the orb, slightly weaker with
each death.

![](images/orb_g3.gif)

Enoch works on the book, but doesn't manage to translate a new chapter.

### 12th of Last Summer, 1501dy

Morning comes and the party continues in their habit of sleeping during the day.

Enoch heads to the library to check and see if there is anything of
use. He does find some language books that help. He then studies while
he waits.

Skeeve studies the orb and learns the following:

![](images/orb_e3.gif)

The day passes and evening comes Just as the sun is setting K'dar
marches out to Endo and tells him to go look for another creature like
last night. He marches northward at a steady pace.

Beck, Thu'fir, Eomer, and Thordek follow at a discrete distance. They
follow him into the dark woods north of town. Once clear of the ears
of outlying farms, Eomer attempts to sneak up behind him and knock him
out. Endo turns and attacks. His movements seem stiff and slow. He's
using the sword and not his hands. Apparently he is just a simple
puppet when under the control of the Queen and not able to make use of
martial arts. This makes the fight a lot easier. The party pile onto
him in a frantic meele of elbows and knees. Thu'fir manages to pull
off the helmet and Endo instantly falls limp. They wake him.

He wakes, panicked that he can't see.

Eomer comforts him, "It's night Endo, give your eyes time to adjust."

"No. I cannot see.", Endo insists.

Enoch brings his glowing mace near. Endo lifts his head to reveal that
his eyes have been sewn shut. "Where is the prince?", Endo demands.

Despite his blindness, he doesn't seem to have lost his dedication to
whatever task he was on. He then says he feels sick and starts
throwing up. Eomer gives him his fighting staff. Endo attempts to put
it on his back, but his things are all gone. Eomer takes the knee pads
and elbow parts of the armor and puts them in his pack. They lead Endo
back into town with Thu'fir's cloak over him.

They sneak him into the inn. Having just attacked an elite guard, they
don't want to be seen strolling back into town with him. They bring
him up to Enoch's room, where Enoch uses his powers to cure Endo's
blindness.

Endo still looks terrible, however. He looks like he's lost a bit of
weight. Since he was all muscle before, this is a bad thing. He is
tired and shaking. They let him sleep. The account of his travels will
have to wait until morning.

## Session 7

### 12th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Late evening)

Pat was late due to work. So his character (Eomer) isn't going to do
or say much for the first half of the session.

Endo asks what has happened to them. He thought his friends had died
in the shipwreck. He is also shocked that they went to so much trouble
to free him.

Skeeve tells the story of what they have been through. He tells Endo
about Breakshore, about Joland Village, about Crossway, Noreeno, the
tomb, the freeing of Mordan, and about their struggles since them.
Endo realizes that he has missed a great deal.

Thu'fir offers Endo some food, but Endo isn't up for eating just yet.
He looks weak and pale. His eyes show that he is still in some pain,
although he is too stoic to mention it. Whatever has happened to him,
it is clear the events of the past few weeks have taken their toll on
him. After a few minutes of quiet reflection, Endo begins his tale in
his deep, raspy voice...

<div class="document">
I washed ashore before dawn. I didn't know if anyone else had
survived. The rain was still pouring down as I knelt on the beach and
coughed the water from my lungs. As I rested, I could see a light
through the trees in the distance. Not knowing if it was from friend
or foe, I drew forward towards the campfire of the Alidian soldiers in
search of warmth.

As I reached the edge of their camp, I found a number of soldiers
beating a young man. They were armed, and there were too many for me
to fight alone. Instead, I circled around the camp to where their
horses were tied and freed all but one. I spooked the horses and they
ran off.

The soldiers stopped and ran off after them, leaving only one man in
the camp to guard their prisoner. I drew near and killed him. I did
not know at the time that he was their commander.

I freed the prisoner and we mounted the remaining horse for our
escape. However, my skill as a rider is limited. The horse bucked and
I nearly fell off. I suppose this is when I dropped my staff, although
I did not know it at the time. I had given it up for lost by the time
I realized it was missing.

My companion's name was Garret. He knew the ways of this land and how
to reach Telwin Port. We traveled together, hoping to escape the
island. We rode to Breakshore, where we had a brief rest in secret
before moving on.

After a few days of travel, Garret revealed to me that he was the
Prince. The Alidians sought to kill him, fearing that he would rise
and take his father's place as Chief Wizard and leader of the
Lormanites. However, Garret knew little of magic and even less of
commanding an army. When he was young, his father sent him away to
study abroad. He spent many years of study in the lands of Dunlock and
Mar Talos. He did not have his father's skills in magic or leadership.
When the city fell, he dressed as a pesant and fled into the
wildnerness, where he was captured. He was sure the enemy would have
discovered who he was and put him to death if I hadn't freed him.

We tried to sneak around Crossway, but scouts spotted us and I was
captured. I was drugged and taken south. I remember nothing since
then. I do not know what became of the prince.
</div>

His story told at last, Endo falls asleep. Everyone else is still on a
nighttime schedule. Most of them just got up a few hours ago, near
sundown. They let Endo rest and retire to their rooms.

Skeeve studies the sphere:

![](images/orb_g4.gif)

Since they fled Crossway they have been moving during the night, and
sleeping during the day, hoping to "hide" their movements from the
enemy. Now Skeeve discovers that this is the exact opposite of what
they should be doing! They need to keep Mordan's orb in sunlight as
much as possible, so that they can keep him in a weakened state as
much as possible.

He studies more:

![](images/orb_e4.gif)

So now they see what would happen if they did destroy the phylactery.
It would kill thousands, weaken the owner, and then allow Mordan to
possess the owner if they survived.

Skeeve goes to Enoch and explains what he learned about needing to
travel during the day.

In the meantime, Enoch has translated another chapter of the book:

<div class="document">
**Part V: The Building of Fol Thron**

*The following is a much reduced version of the history of Mar Tesoro
between the rule of King Lorman and the rise of the second Dwarven
King.*

â€“ Chronicler Norvus

King Lorman ruled and mined Khelberg for twenty years, when he was
assassinated by one of his own lieutenants, a human foreman named
Ingol. Ingol was a brutal leader but did not have the insight and
cunning of his former master. His chief enforcers were more Orcs than
Humans, and he ruled by fear and cruelty.

The Dwarves heard of the fall of Lorman and saw that Ingol was a weak
leader. They attempted once again to reclaim Khelberg. Their forces
landed on the southern shores of Mar Tesoro and pushed north. Few who
worked in the mines were willing to fight to defend their cruel
master, and Ingol was defeated before the end of the fifth year of his
reign. As the war ended, many humans fled north and settled in those
lands.

In those days the mining had begun to take its toll on the valley. The
mountain was now naked of trees and grass, and the water that flowed
down from the hills was dark and filled with the dust and waste of the
mines. The Greenlands turned gray, and crops failed. The inhabitants
were obliged to move away from the foot of the mountain.

The Dwarves built a great city southwest of the mountain and called it
Fol Thron. They ruled from this place and sent many workers to live in
harsh camps at the foot of Khelberg.

Although they were invaded twice, the Dwarves held the mines for fifty
years. Even when not facing full-scale invasion from Humans or Elves,
they were regularly harassed by bands of Orcs from out of the North,
who came often to raid shipments of food and gold.
</div>

### 13th of Last Summer, 1501dy

In the morning Endo wakes and goes outside to stand in the sun.

The party decides to spend another day in this town, with Skeeve
studying the orb and Enoch studying the book. They hope the extra time
spent in study will yield the answers they need on the road ahead.
They also hope to change their sleep schedule so that they are no
longer awake at night and asleep during the day.

But first, it is pointed out to them that Endo has no money. In fact,
the only things he owns are the pants he's wearing and the staff he's
holding. Skeeve takes him shopping for basic supplies: Backpack,
bedroll, food, and some basic commoner clothing. Endo spends the
remainder of the day at rest, recovering from his ordeal of the last
few weeks.

In the meantime, Thordek meets with Magistrate Stonefist and explains
that they need travel papers for their two friends. The dwarf offers
travel papers for 500 gold a piece. They pay, and the papers are drawn
up.

The day passes. Enoch completes work on another chapter:

<div class="document">
**Part VI: Notes on Geographical Names**

*The name "Khelberg" is simply the Dwarven rendering of "The Mountain"
in Common Speech. This seems an odd name for the Dwarves to have
chosen, given their habit of naming mountains after the Dwarf who
first discovered, owned, or mined them. Perhaps Khelberg was so great
in their minds that they did not think any of their names would be
worthy, and so left the mountain "nameless" by calling it Khelberg.*

*It should also be noted that Khelberg is not a single mountain, but a
small cluster that is roughly horseshoe-shaped. It was the custom of
both Dwarves and Elves in the Earlier Days to name the hills in groups
this way. It is said that the Dwarves had names for each of the peaks
within Khelberg, although I have not found any record of them. The
other races that dwell there now have continued the habit of referring
to the entire group as Khelberg, as if it were a single mountain.*

*In the center of the crescent is a wide flat valley. Of old it was
simply called "Greenlands" by the Elves, although that name was
dropped once it ceased being green. As the valley turned gray and
filled with gravel and brackish water, the city was largely abandoned
and became little more than mining camps. At one time the elves (when
they had control of Khelberg) gave the camps the name Della Minera
("The Mining Valley", in Common) and the name remained, although the
Elves did not.*

*Other notable names on the island include Tal Podere, (in Elven, "the
Farmlands"), Tal Lengo (in Elven, "the woods"), Valle Calma (in Elven
"Silent Valley"), and Fol Thron (in Dwarven "Strong Throne").*

*The island itself is still called by its original name Mar Tesoro,
which means (very roughly) "Treasures Island", or perhaps "Island of
great value". Is it possible that the Elves were aware of the gold and
gems in the mountain, yet chose to leave them be? Or is the name
speaking of the value of the island as a place to live, and not of the
riches it contained? It is impossible to know, as the legends from
those days are few and unreliable.*

*Another curious fact is that although Elves and men have captured the
city of Fol Thron many times, it has never been renamed. It has been
the capital city of many empires, yet still bears its original Dwarven
name.*

â€“ Chronicler Norvus
</div>

The party reads over this latest section of the book. It is not as
helpful as they might have hoped.

Skeeve studies as well. He spends his time outside, making sure to
keep the orb in daylight so as to keep Mordan in a weakened state.

![](images/orb_o4.gif)

While they wait, they have a long debate on the rules of Mordan's
Phylactery. They discuss various plans, such as dropping it into the
ocean, having the owner commit suicide, burying it, and various other
things that could be done (not that any of them is seriously
contemplating suicide) to defeat Mordan forever. They examine the
rules Skeeve has uncovered so far, looking for a weakness or a
loophole they might exploit.

The conversation ends without arriving at any answers. Skeeve studies
the orb again, and unlocks the final secret:

![](images/orb_k4.gif)

He can now study the orb without revealing his position to the Lich.
However, since this was the last secret, he no longer needs to study
it. Still this explains how the undead monsters have found them each
night: For the last several days they have been keeping the orb in
darkness and studying it regularly so that Mordan would always know
where they were. They were actually helping him.

> To sum up the challenges of defeating Mordan:
>
> * He was once the most feared and terrible rulers of this island.
>   This is a big deal, since there have been a lot of rotten tyrants
>   here over the centuries. He was a wizard (Lich) of such vast power
>   that he could take on armies.
>
> * It took several of the most powerful heroes in the world to defeat

>
> * He's lost an undetermined portion of his former power. He needs to
>   reclaim the orb in order to recover this lost power.

Late afternoon becomes early evening. At this point they have been
awake for a long time. Having remained awake all day, they now retire
for the night. Tomorrow they plan to head south.

### 14th of Last Summer, 1501dy

They wake after midnight. They plan to leave when the sun comes up. While they wait, Enoch studies and obtains another chapter:

<div class="document">
**Part VII: The Middle Years**

*This section will highlight the middle years of Mar Tesoro. Again, a
full account would fill many books but the record of conquest is given
here in order to complete the timeline of this book. The reader should
be aware that this list is very brief and leaves out many important
figures and events. True students of history should consult other
volumes to learn about these events in detail.*

- Chronicler Norvus

The Dwarves held the mines for fifty years, enduring two sieges and
many Orcish raids from out of the north before finally falling to the
Elves.

The Elves appointed a king, who was assassinated within weeks, and
then replaced by King Loemus. Loemus survived two attempts on his
life, one from human assassins and one from among his own advisers. He
was maimed in the second attempt, and as time went on he became more
paranoid. He executed countless people he suspected of plotting
against him. His purge was so vigorous that work stopped in the mines
for some time because he lacked competent leaders.

The kingdom of Loemus collapsed on itself and many other forces moved
in to seize the mines. From here a proper account of ownership becomes
difficult. War raged around the mountain for several years, and more
than once there were multiple factions mining from from different
sides of Khelberg.

After a decade of fighting, a Human female named Rhone gained the
mastery in the conflict, aided by a large group of Wizards. They drove
the other forces from the mountain, captured Fol Thron, and set up a
Mageocracy. This was the most diverse and stable government the land
had known since the fall of Ellas Morad and the original
Mountain-Elves.

It was during this time that the Mage Wars raged in Dunlock. As that
war ended, the Guild of Mages was formed. (See also, The Mage Wars
Vol. III and the charter for the Guild of Mages) Since members of the
guild were generally discouraged (but not prohibited) from making war
openly with one another, this had the effect of strengthening the rule
of Mistress Rhone. If anyone sought to oppose or oust her, they could
usually only attract non-guild mages, who were generally weaker or
less disciplined.

Mistress Rhone was, by all accounts, the most peaceful and patient of
all the leaders of Khelberg. While she put down many rebellions, she
had a habit of imprisoning her foes instead of the usual policy of
public execution that had been the norm for centuries. During her
reign she fought two successful wars against foes attempting to
reclaim Khelberg, and finally died of an unknown poison after ruling
for thirty years.
</div>

They have breakfast and prepare their horses for travel. As the sun
comes up, they see a crowd has gathered at the northern gate. Some
people are weeping and there seems to be some trouble. Thordek heads
over and speaks to the Magistrate, who is waiting at the gate, looking
tense.

Magistrate Stonefist explains that two strange creatures attacked
during the night. They tried to enter the town in secret, were
discovered, and a battle ensued. The creatures took the lives of two
of the guards before they were slain. Then one of the guards, who was
clearly dead only moments before, rose up and attacked his former
friends. Once defeated, all three bodies were taken to a field north
of town and burned.

The magistrate described the creature as a gaunt humanoid with massive
claws. Thordek recalls the creatures they fought in Dockhouse days
earlier.

Thordek offers assistance, but the Magistrate declines. There is
nothing more to be done at this point. After saying their goodbyes
they set out, heading south. They have seven party members, yet only
threee horses. They leave town with people taking turns walking and
riding.

The party travels south until dark, and finally makes camp along the
road.

They have traveled at walking speed heading toward Hillstead. It is
getting dark and they decide they need to make camp. Skeeve suggests
they have a full camp with a campfire, and that two people stand watch
instead of just one. Enoch consecrates the ground and a fire is built.
Throughout the night, Skeeve has a creepy feeling â€“ as if someone is
watching him.

The night passes without incident.

### 15th of Last Summer, 1501dy (Morning)

Skeeve wakes in the morning, sweaty and full of dread. He dreamed that
some black-cloaked being was standing watching, beckoning him to
relinquish the orb. In his dream Skeeve stood still, frozen with fear
until finally he handed over the orb. He wakes and finds the orb is
still at his side. Skeeve quietly tells Enoch about the dream, but no
one else.

Thordek notices Skeeve's obvious panic when waking and asks him about
it. Skeeve doesn't tell him anything.

Endo gets up and wanders around the camp, stretching and doing one
single push-up. Endo is still weak and recovering from his ordeal. He
does seem to be getting stronger, though.

They review the map:

![](images/map_mar_tesaro.gif)

They determine they are probably halfway from Tal Podere to Hillstead.
They proceed south.

They head south. The hills roll by at a steady pace as the day slips
by. To the east is the great expanse of evergreens known as Pinestaff.
To the southeast they can see the foreboding peaks of Khelberg
reaching up beyond the rolling blue-green of Pinestaff. To the south
they can see the woods eventually give way to smooth green fields.

After a few hours they come to a fork in the road. They consult the
map and head toward Hillstead. At about mid-afternoon they crest a
hill and they see the village of Hillstead below. The huts seem small.
They ride into town and find it to be a halfling village. This is
obviously a farming community, with many farms dotting the surrounding
countryside.

There is a standard detachment of Alidian guards at the entrance to
the city: A group of bored Ailidian soldiers, and four elite guards.
After their papers are checked, they are granted entry into the city
proper.

The "streets" of the city are simple dirt paths that wind around the
clusters of tidy cottages and small gardens. Many homes have a ribbon
of smoke that drifts upward from the chimney. The smell of food is in
the air as the halflings ready their evening meals. The town is quiet
and unhurried. The party is greeted with polite but uninterested
smiles if they are noticed at all.

They check into the inn, which is small by the standards of most
towns, although here it towers over the other buildings. There are
"big people" rooms available, although the rooms still feel quite
small to the humans in the group.

Enoch settles in to study his book.

Skeeve visits the Magistrate Witman, who is a stout old Halfling.
Skeeve asks if there are have been any attacks on the town by undead.
Whitman is amused by this, and makes it plain that this town sees
little in the way of excitment. Skeeve also tries to see if perhaps
Garret came through here. He asks carefully if a lone human, a young
adult male, has passed this way. The Magistrate hasn't seen anyone
like that lately. Lone travelers are rare these days, and a young
human passing through would certainly have caught his notice.

In the meantime, Thu'fir and Thordek visit the blacksmith, hoping to
get some new gear. Their hopes are dashed when they see that this
blacksmith concentrates on plows, horseshoes, farming tools, and other
uninteresting items. He has little in the way of battle gear, and what
he does have is fairly basic. Thu'fir is annoyed. He's been looking
for a grapple hook since they left Joland Vallage, and can't believe
that such a simple item is so difficult to obtain.

However, the blacksmith does have one thing that catches their eye: a
horse. The blacksmith owns a single, patchy, old, sick-looking horse.
It is a sad, droopy beast with patchy black and grey fur.

Thu'fir inspects the animal. While old, it isn't dying. It could
certainly bear a rider, albeit at a slow pace. Thu'fir negotiates a
price of 200g for the sick horse, which is named Thunder. They pay for
the horse and leave.

They retire for the night at the inn.

### 16th of Last Summer

In the morning they leave the town of Hillstead. They make much better
time today, since they now have enough horses so that everyone can
ride. Two people ride each of the Alidian horses, and Beck rides
Thunder alone.

During the journey they see more traffic on the road. Some are single
horsemen, speeding past them without a word; doubtless Alidian
messengers of some sort. They also see merchants and other travelers
heading both north and south. Thet can sense they are drawing nearer
to the capital city to the south.

After midday the road turns east. Directly south is a vast expanse of
grasslands. In the distance they can see the dark outline of the
towering Citadel. The map tells that it lies on the other side of a
river. They could cross the grasslands and walk over the river (with
Enoch's help) but then they would be obliged to abandon their horses.
Instead, they elect to follow the road east and cross over the bridge.
This will take them many miles out of their way, and prevent them from
reaching Fol Thron today, but it will let them keep their horses.

They finally come to the river. This is obviously the river that flows
from the feet of Khelberg to the western sea. A great stone bridge,
obviously old and of Dwarven make, spans the wide, slow river. A small
camp is built on the southern side of the bridge, and a dozen soldiers
stand guard on the bridge itself.

Their papers are carefully inspected before they are allowed to
proceed.

The grass on this side of the river looks pale and unhealthy. The
trees are sparse, small, and twisted. Everything seems to be drained
of color and life. The grey slopes of Khelberg loom large to the east.

As the sun sets, they come upon Della Minera, which is obviously a
human-built mining camp. The western side of town is a collection of
various businesses that cater to travelers. There is a large inn, a
tavern, some stables, and other places where travel goods might be
purchased. The east side of town is a simple collection of shanty
buildings near a fire pit and a latrine. Between these two halves of
the town is a large fence, watched by guards. The party infers that
the eastern side of town is inhabited by slaves who work the mines.

They decide to stay at the inn. Thu'fir goes to the blacksmith and
asks about a grappling hook. He's been trying to get his hands on one
since they faced the trap doors in the Wizard's lair outside of Joland
Village. He hasn't been able to find one for sale until now. When he
finds they are for sale here, he buys two â€“ along with a good supply
of rope. He won't be caught unprepared again.

During the night, Skeeve has another nighmare in which Mordan asks him
for the orb, and he relinquishes it.

### 17th of Last Summer

Skeeve wakes, shaken from his latest nightmare. He tells Enoch about
what he saw in the dream.

The party memebers meet in Enoch's room to plan the day. Enoch reveals
that during the night he was able to translate another chapter of the
book:

<div class="document">
**Part VIII: Archmage Mordan**

Mistress Rhone never married or had any offspring, so at her death her
post fell to Archmage Mordan, her chief military adviser. Mordan
arrested many foreigners travelling in his lands, including many
diplomats. He imprisoned and tortured them, saying they were spies. He
sent many antagonizing messages to various Dwarven and Elven leaders,
and did many other deeds to provoke his enemies. While Rhone had
sometimes avoided open war when possible, Mordan sought it out at
every opportunity.

Even his harshest critics admitted that he was without equal at the
business of warfare. He was a great seer, and could at many times view
the future actions of his enemies. Within months he had utterly
exterminated the Orcs to the north. He initiated and won a number of
wars against both Elves and Dwarves, and conquered the northern lands
of Mar Tesoro, bringing the entire country under his rule.

While Rhone was among the most gentle of leaders to sit in Fol Thron,
Mordan was without question the most ruthless. The common workers in
the mines became slaves, which were worked ceaselessly. Mordan decreed
that the slaves should work so hard that a third should die each year.
He replaced the lost slaves with the captured soldiers he won in his
many battles, and with peasants taken from the farms of the north.

The people of the city fared little better. Laws were brutal under his
rule, and many perished in his dungeons for the most trivial offenses.
He could enter the minds of his subjects, see their thoughts and vex
their dreams. Any that might oppose him in secret were known to him,
and soon driven mad with visions and nightmares.

Mordan was a student of history, and knew too well how briefly other
rulers had held their position as master of Khelberg. He said many
times that he planned to be the final master of Khelberg, and that
none would supplant him.

The years of his rule grew long. He surpassed a hundred years of age,
and although he was thin and gaunt, he retained the vigor of youth. He
became reclusive, and ran his empire through his servants, who were
all mighty wizards in their own right. They did his will, spreading
his cruelty and malice as far as his power would allow.

The years drew on, and the wealth of the mines was used to expand the
city. The palace grew, a great trench was dug around it, and was
filled with water from the nearby lake. This new moat was filled with
many watery beasts and fell creatures of the deep, so that none dared
approach the palace for fear of being dragged from the bridge by some
unseen horror. The palace was then renamed the Citadel, and began to
look unlike the great fortress the Dwarves had built. It was dark and
twisted, and few dared to lift their eyes to look upon it, even in the
daytime.

The power of the Archmage Mordan far surpassed that of any other,
until there were none that dared challenge him in battle. His foes
relented, and drew back. After centuries of war, Khelberg at last
belonged to one man alone, uncontested.
</div>

It makes them uneasy to read of Mordan, even in the light of day.
However, it is a relief to see the time they've invested in the book
is finally paying off, and they are learning about their new foe.
Enoch estimates that the book is about halfway complete. They are
eager to learn more, but decide to push on to Fol Thron instead of
lingering here for more studying.

The party heads downstairs where they find Beck in the dining area,
having an animated conversation with a one-legged man. The man looks
hard and shabby, and is dressed like the slaves that inhabit the
eastern side of town. Beck has evidently bought this man a beer and is
questioning him. As the rest of the party comes downstairs, they can
hear the man telling Beck a story...

As he leans in his chair he rambles on, "...day I wanted to see what it
would be like if I left the helmet off. I wanted to see what the place
looked like, and what went on while we were wearing the helmets. So I
didn't put my mining helmet on all the way. I sort of held it over my
head. Everyone else had put them on like they were supposed to, so
they were just mindlessly marching into the mines. I got behind them
and followed them in.

"It wasn't until I was inside that I realized the truth: There are no
lights in that mine. Nothing. Quick enough I got lost in the darkness,
and had no choice but to drop the helmet onto my head. That evening I
â€˜woke up' outside the mine, tired, just like I did every other day.
When we took off our helmets, we didn't remember a thing from what
we'd been doing in the mines. It seemed like we'd just put the helmets
on a moment before, except we'd be exhausted."

At this point Beck sets is mug down and asks, "Okay, fair enough. But
what happened to your leg?"

The man draws a deep breath, "Oh, THAT day. Well, we're used finding
ourselves at the end of the day with lots of cuts or bruises. Of
course, we didn't feel it until we took the helmet off. So, every day
when I dropped the helmet on my head in the morning, I'd wonder what
I'd find when it comes off again in the evening. Sometimes I'd find
meself outside with a bad gash, and found I'd I bled all over myself
while I worked. Some times I'd have a big scrape or bruise or
maybe..."

"Or a leg missing?", Thu'fir added, now that they had joined the two
men at the table.

"Yeah. I took the helmet off and almost passed out from the pain. I
looked down to see I'd broken my leg. It had snapped just below the
knee. The terrible part was that it looked like I just kept working
the rest of the day with the broken leg. By the time the helmet came
off the bottom of my leg had been ruined."

The man smiles, "At the time I thought this was a bad deal, but now
I'm useless in the mines and I don't have to work there anymore. So it
was really the best thing that ever happened to me. Of course, now
they gimmie other duties. These days I stay in town and make rope. And
right now, they don't need no more rope, so it looks like the Queen's
willing to feed me just for sitting around all day doin' nothing.
Thats agreeable enough to me."

They all drink on this point.

Thu'fir then asks, "So are these the same sort of helmets that are
worn by the Queen's special guards?"

The man shruggs, "I wouldn't know, I've never tried one of those on.
They LOOK different, though. Our mining caps just cover the tops of
our heads and come down to our cheekbones. They look more or less like
regular mining caps except they are too long, and cover the eyes. Most
of use like it because you do a full days work without having to do
the work, if you take my meaning. We just put on the hats, and at the
end of the day they come off and we're just tired and hungry."

He takes another drink and continues, "Of course, it wasn't all good.
sometimes we'd get to the end of the day and find we'd lost somebody.
We'd have no idea how or where, or what happened to them. They were
just gone. Probably trapped in the mines someplace or killed. For all
we know, we could be marching over them every day while we work."

Thu'fir then asks, "Does your mining camp mine for gems or gold, or
what?"

He shruggs again, "I don't know. By the time we remove the helmets,
someone has come and emptied the carts. We can see we dug up
SOMETHING. The carts have bits or rock and dust in them, but whatever
we were mining has been taken away by the time the helmets come off."

"Where are you from?" Thu'fir asks.

"I'm from Woodhurst, to the north. We got conquered about nine months
ago. Since I was a soldier, they carted me off, and put me here. I
should be grateful, though. Most times, when you get conquered, you
get killed. But they let me live. Then I got a lucky break. My leg got
broken and then got all nasty and infected and had to get cut off."

"Oh yes. Very lucky.", Thordek adds wryly.

"Well, I fared a lot better than some..."

Thu'fir agrees, "I'd rather sit in town weaving rope than spend twelve
hours a day being mindless."

They wish the man well and get ready to leave. They intend to head
west, for the capital city of Fol Thron. They gather the horses and
prepare for the day's journey.

### 17th of Last Summer (Morning)

The party sets out, heading for the capital city of Fol Thron to the
west. The road between Fol Thron and Della Minera is very busy. They
are in the heart of the Alidian territory now, and they see many
people along the road as they travel.

Fol Thron is a massive, sprawling city full of stone towers and
bridges. If Dwarves were to make a habit of building cities above
ground, they would doubtless look much like this one. Canals carry a
bit of the river through the city in key areas, where mills and other
enterprises might make use of its strength.

The city is a semicircle, built in concentric rings eminating from the
dark Citadel on the northern edge of town, along the river. Most of
the major streets converge on a central district just in front of the
Citadel.

Eomer the Rogue, Thordek the Fighter, Enoch the Cleric, Thu'fir the
Blade Lord, Endo the Monk, and Beck the (former) first mate of Ocean's
Majesty, all enter the town on horseback. As they enter, their papers
are examined and they are questioned thoroughly by the gate guards. At
last they are allowed to pass.

Once inside, they stable their horses. The party intends to head for
the central district and see what use they can make of the few hours
of daylight they have left.

Beck bids them good-night. There are shabby (but affordable) lodgings
available here near the gates of the city. Despite the generous
donations the others have given him, he still prefers to live
meagerly, hoping to save as much as possible. His mind is still on
Talla and the coming baby, and he wants to make sure he has enough to
provide for them.

The others wish him well, and head down the broad cobblestone street
that leads to the heart of the city. More than once bridges cary the
street over the canal as it winds through the buildings. As they
proceed, the buildings change from simple two-story human dwellings to
ornate and impressive structures owned by various businesses or the
governing body of the city.

At last they reach the central square (which, as in Crossway, is
called such despite being circular) and stare upwards in wonder. They
are now at the feet of the great dark Citadel of Fol Thron. The
building bears the frame of Dwarven make, although many sharp spikes
and pointy towers have been added on since the initial construction,
giving the place a malevolent appearance. Many bridges and balconies
cling to the sides of the towers as they reach ever upwards. While it
once had many hundereds of windows looking outward, they have now all
been bricked over or covered with sharp plates of metal, embossed with
the symbol of Queen Alidia:

![](images/flag.gif)

The citadel seems to be on an island all by itself. All around it is a
deep, empty chasam. A lone bridge, blocked by a single massive door,
allows travel from the central square to the gates of the Citadel. The
doors are shut and guarded by a group of severe Alidian soldiers.

Also in the square is the tower of the Mage's Guild. It is a simple
spire of brown stone, crowned with what looks like an observatory. In
any other setting it would have looked tall and impressivle, although
it looks diminutive in the presence of the Citadel.

Elsewhere they see the Archives; the city library, a church of
impressive proportions, a sprawling inn with many wings, and a number
of unidtentified government buildings. Around the edges of the square
are several specialty shops and booths.

Eomer and Endo check into the Inn. Endo in particular looks tired and
in need of rest.

Skeeve heads for the Mage's guild. Thu'fir and Thordek look for a
blacksmith. Enoch visits the Archives.

The city Archives is a simple building of smooth grey stone positioned
opposite the Citadel. It is easily the largest library on the island.
Inside, the gloomy light of late afternoon drifts in through the many
tall narrow windows, forming fingers of light through the dusty air.
There is the murmur of hushed voices from among the shelves of books
as Enoch enters. To his left is a large circle of chairs that seems to
be some sort of council meeting area. A large set of windows encircles
the chairs, wrapping them in pale afternoon light. Opposite this area
is the scribarium, where a dozen or so young alcolytes work in
silence, making copies of books that have become worn or damaged.
Directly ahead is the library proper, where towering shelves of books
stand beneath the great arched ceiling above.

As Enoch enters, one of the keepers emerges from the shadows and bows
respectfully. His deep voice intones, "Welcome your holiness. How may
I be of service?"

Enoch casts his eyes about the place, unsure of where he should start.
At last he answers, "Well, I'm interested in books."

The keeper raises and eyebrow, "Indeed. Well we do have some books
here. What sorts of books might you be looking for?"

"Well, any books dealing with defeating Mordan?"

The keeper chuckles, thinking Enoch is speaking in jest, "Oh indeed. I
suppose if I were after Mordan I might need some help as well. But
come, what is it that you truly need?"

Enoch insists, "I really do need books on Mordan", and then after a
moment's reflection, ""For a... project I'm researching."

The keeper is a bit alarmed at this, but nevertheless he leads Enoch
back into the maze of towering shelves. After a polite moment he
finally asks, "If I may sir â€“ Why are you researching... him?"

Enoch follows as they wind their way, deeper into the library, "I've
been working on translating a book."

The keeper is intrigued by this, "Oh indeed? What sort of book?"

Enoch produces the Book of Norvus and shows it to him.

When his eyes fall on the book, the keeper is delighted, "The
mysterious book! You've managed to make some headway!", he thumbs
though the translated pages, "More than half of it, by the looks of
things. This is quite exciting. Councilman Relnar will be delighted."

He stops and gestures about the library, "Most of the members of the
council have tried their hand at the book, and none of us could manage
to crack it. Everyone has their own theories about what the work
contains. I myself suspect that it is a recent copy of a very ancient
work. But wait. Let me summon what council members are available and
you can tell us what you've found."

Enoch is a bit irritated by this. He was hoping to find help in
translating the rest of the book, not give an account of what he'd
already done. He says nothing, and lets the keeper have his way.

A council convenes. They meet in the circle of chairs near the large
windows. Out of the sixteen available seats, less than half are
filled. Councilman Relnar welcomes Enoch and bids him sit with them.

He begins, "So, I understand you've manged to translate some of our
mysterious book. You know, there's a reward if you're able to complete
it. This book appeared here, mysteriously, about two years ago. Most
of us have tried our hand at translating it and failed. I have to
admit that we have been keen to know what secrets it held. The fact
that we did not know the source of the book and could not make any
headway with it only fed our curiosity. Eventually I sent it north,
along with the offer of a reward, in hopes that other scholars might
find the book and have better luck with it. So tell us, Enoch servant
of Pelor, what have you found? What is the origin of this mysterious
tome?"

Enoch stands, "Well, I found the book was written, or at least
translated, by someone named Chonicler Norvus."

At the mention of this name several of the council members become
irritated or even openly outraged. They all begin speaking at once.

After a few moments Enoch tries to get some sort of explanation.
Relnar waves his question aside and asks, "Very well. So what is the
book about?"

Enoch looks down at the book, "Well, it looks like the history of your
island..."

One of the other keepers interjects, "Let me guess... a collection of
folklore?" The others begin laughing.

Enoch isn't quite sure what to make of this. Finally Relnar exclaims,
"Exile was too good for him." Others nod in agreement.

Relnar turns to Enoch an explains, "What you have there my friend is a
book of banned folk tales, a bunch of heresy and nonsense, set down by
a former collegue. He has written this work against both the rules and
wishes of this council, in an effort to propigate the ridiculous tales
it contains."

Another keeper inquires, "But why did he write it in such a strange
and archaic form? Why not set his story down plainly?"

Relnar answers, "Isn't it obvious? He did so to conceal the work from
us."

The keeper nods in annoyance, "Yes, yes. But then why did he plant the
book here among us, if he were trying to hide it? And what good is the
tale if he writes it in a language that none can read?"

Relnar dismisses the question, "Simple enough. The man was a fool. We
sould not be surprised when such a man perpetrates foolish deeds. In
any event, the archaic language did not conceal the meaning from this
outsider. Norvus has managed to pass his heresy onto our guest here."
Relnar then turns to Enoch, "I am sorry you were misled by this. If we
had any idea that this book was of Norvus' doing, we would never have
sent it abroad, much less offered the reward. Of course, I will not go
back on my word. If you complete the translation, I'll still give your
the reward, although I can't imagine anyone being interested in it."

Relnar shakes his head in disappointment, "What a shame. We really
thought the book held some great mysteries."

Enoch asks, "So what makes you believe this is just folklore?"

Relnar frowns at him, "Well, just to start: A mountain that curses
people? This doesn't stike you as particularly absurd?"

Enoch is now defiant, "Have you looked at your country recently?"

Several members snicker, others bristle at his words. There is a long
silence. At last Relnar responds, "Well friend, believe what you like.
I should warn you that these stories are banned by the Queen. They do
not cast her in a good light, and you would do well to keep them to
yourself."

Relnar then gestures to one of the empty chairs, "Chronicler Norvus
once stood here and debated this with us at length. I doubt you will
have anything new to add to his arguments. Now that I recall, it was
six months after we dismissed his arguments that this mysterious book
appeared on our shelves, was passed around and eventually sent north.
How disappointing. Well, he's in exile now, so hopefully we've seen
the end of his mischief."

The talk then turns to the business of the translation itself. Enoch
reveals that his knowledge of a few obscure Dunlock forms was what
enabled him to understand the difficult script. Relnar offers a few
books (on loan) from the library that should aid Enoch in finishing
the book. These books help illuminate some of the other difficult
languages in the book, and will greatly speed his efforts.

Enoch then asks where Norvus might be.

Relnar shrugs, "I'm sure I have no idea. We threw him out. Havn't
heard from him since."

"Is he still around here? I mean..."

"Heavens, we threw him out of the room, not the country! We're not
barbarians. He's still a learned man, I'm sure he's made use of
himself somewhere..."

"Telling fairy tales!", interrupts another keeper.

"Writing children's stories!", cries another.

The room disolves into derisive laughter.

Enoch thanks them for their time and turns to leave. As he walks out,
Relanr gives him a final request, "Good luck to you sir. If you do
find him, give him our best and, you know, drop a few coppers into his
cup for us."

Enoch strides out of the room as the council again breaks into
laughter.

### 7th of Last Summer (Evening)

Enoch retires to his room for the evening and sets to work translating
the book. With the aid of the reference books on loan from the
Archives, he is able to make amazing progress. Over the next few hours
he manages to translate three new chapters of the book:

<div class="document">
**Part IX: The Grave Walkers**

*Much of the following information is guesswork on my part. A great
deal of knowledge was lost during this period, and some facts are now
beyond the reach of any historian. The reader should be aware that I
stand by all of the following as being as accurate as possible, yet
incomplete.*

- Chronicler Norvus

The reign of Archmage Mordan reached its hundredth year. At length
people began to wonder if he had died, and his assistants only
pretended he yet lived. Mordan had not been seen in over twenty years,
and had long since passed the natural lifespan of his kind. For the
first time since his rule began, a small group of slaves dared to
challenge their masters and seek freedom. They broke from their prison
in Della Minera and sought the open country to the north.

It was then that Mordan at last revealed himself. No longer a man, he
was now the unliving master of Khelberg: Mordan the dread Lich King.
He appeared amidst the fleeing slaves and slew them with a single
word. They gave up their spirits and fell at his feet. Within the hour
their bodies had risen again to become the first of his most fearsome
servants. They were the Grave Walkers, the terrible footsoldiers of
his lifeless army. He slew many in this way, both foe and servant
alike, and their ranks grew.

At length he discovered that the more bitter his victim's death, the
stronger and more viscous they were in unlife. He took many Elves and
Humans and tormented them for years before allowing them to die. He
invented many new spells and potions to aid him in extending the lives
of his victims and intensifying their agony. So it was that each
generation of Grave Walkers was more fearsome than the one before.

He took all of the people of the north and brought them south as
slaves. The men were sent to work in the mines, while the women were
made to live in Della Minera and used like cattle for the breeding of
more slaves. The children were taken within the Citadel and taught to
worship the Lich King as a god.

A decade passed and the first of Mordan's children emerged from the
Citadel. They were twisted and cruel, and wielded many strange magics
in his name.

The work in the mines increased, and great smelting furnaces were
built on the mountainside to purify his gold and silver. Day and night
they burned, until the sky above the mountain was the color of ash.

Despite his boundless supply of gold, the peoples of other nations
refused to trade with him, for he would take what he wanted from any
ship that came close to his shores. The ships he would plunder and
sink, while their crews were sent to his mines to work until they
died. He grew bold, doing all he could to provoke war and make
enemies. Even the evilest of creatures feared to serve him, for he
held all life in contempt.

The gold and riches of the mountain were hoarded deep within the
Citadel, where none could reach them or put them to use. He proclaimed
loudly that the riches of the world were hidden within his Citadel for
any that had the courage to face him. Heroes emerged at the rumor of
treasure, and many adventurers traveled to Mar Tesoro to attempt to
unseat him. All were slain and added to his army of Grave Walkers. He
feared no foe in all the Earth.

As the power of the Lich King continued to grow beyond measure, the
other nations of the world began to wonder if he did not plan to
conquer all. The Elven kings of southern Dunlock joined together, and
called on their sometime enemies of the north to join with them
against this common threat, before Mordan became too strong for any to
oppose.
</div>

<div class="document">
**Part X: Tomb of The Lich King**

The armies of Dunlock, from the greatest to the least of its kingdoms,
gathered together to give one final challenge to Mordan the Dread
Lich. Elf and Dwarf, Human and Halfling, all met the armies of Mordan
at the foot of the cursed mountain. The Grave Walkers marched into
battle along with many slaves and fell beasts under the control of of
Mordan. The battle lasted many weeks, and unspeakable magic was
unleashed on both sides.

The Dunlock forces, led by the Elven Songmage Lucan Forwinol, at last
had the mastery. Mordan's forces were pushed back and then
annihilated. Forwinol advanced and captured â€“ at the expense of many
lives â€“ the once-great Citadel.

Forwinol knew Mordan was undefeatable as a lich. If slain, his form
would re-appear at the next sundown. The only hope was to find and
destroy Mordan's Phylactery, the container of his life-force.

Most Lich would hide such an item, but Mordan was proud and cunning,
and his Phylactery was on display at the Citadel. And then Forwinol at
last saw why Mordan was so fearless: The Phylactery was trapped with
many spells so that none would dare destroy it.

Forwinol was wise and learned in magic, and saw a way to defeat the
Dread Lich without breaking the Phylactery. Instead he added to the
spells of the Phylactery, making a new binding spell that would hold
Mordan when he re-appeared after a defeat.

A tomb was built in an empty valley north of the mountain. The
Phylactery was then used to seal his prison. When all was ready, the
armies met and defeated Mordan himself, at the cost of many lives.
When he rose again, his form took shape within the tomb sealed with
his own Phylactery. He was trapped, and could not escape without
destroying his own Phylactery, and thus himself. He had been
outsmarted.

But Lucan Forwinol knew this was not enough. Someday one of the many
Children of the Citadel may seek to free him, or the tomb forgotten
and hapless adventurers discover it. So Forwinol had added one final
touch: Whoever freed Mordan would be the subject of one final binding
spell. This spell would place Mordan's power on the head or heads of
whoever freed him. He would not be able to recover his former might
until he killed them.

Thus, any that freed him would be doomed. Not even his most loyal
followers would accept unlife as a Grave Walker to free their master.
Warnings were engraved in many languages and placed about the entrance
to his tomb, and a great stone slab was placed over it.

Mordan was forever trapped, and none would dare to free him. At last
the mighty Lich was defeated.
</div>

<div class="document">
**Part XI: The Triumvirate of Fol Thron**

While Lucan Forwinol brought Mordan to his final defeat in the north,
his allies in war had secured the great city of Fol Thron. Forwinol
had taken no plunder, save for the Phylactery of the Lich King. No
other treasure touched his hands.

Yet so great was the rumor of treasure in the Citadel that many heroes
came fourth and challenged the depths of the fortress. The treasure
was recovered and taken away, the moat drained, and the many evil
spells and traps of the place were removed.

Then began a great debate over who should be the new master of the
mines. Forwinol proclaimed to his allies that the place was wholly
evil and cursed, that they should set aside the plunder, return to
their homes, and leave the mountain empty.

But those that had fought so hard for the prize were slow to release
it. Seeing that the debate would lead to war, he proposed that the
strongest of the forces should each appoint a leader, and that they
should rule together as a triumvirate. Forwinol then decided that his
work was done, and returned to his homeland in Mar Talos.

The triumvirate was made from three great leaders: For the Dwarves,
King Konal Stonefist, the Elves had Mistress Myran Allidia, and the
Humans had King Pallas Lorman.

Lorman was descended through many generations from the King Lorman of
old, the first human King of Khelberg. Like his grandsire, Pallas
Lorman was a strong leader as well as a fearsome commander of arcane
magic.

The Dwarven King Konal Stonefist was the first to betray the
triumvirate. During the twentieth year of their reign, he gathered in
secret many Dwarves and tried to make Fol Thron his own. The other two
leaders joined and defeated him.

The remaining two leaders distrusted one another, and accused each
other many times of various plots and schemes. Lorman at last rallied
many humans to his side, and tried to wrest control of the Citadel
from Allidia. He caught her unawares, and used many strange magics
against her. She survived his ambush, but was blinded in the attack.
Her own forces rallied. Yet another war was fought. Lorman was
defeated and fled north with his followers, where his family still
rules to this day.
</div>

Having completed this work, Enoch goes to sleep for the night...

### 17th of Last Summer (Evening)

At the same time Enoch is visiting the Archives, Skeeve visits the
Mageâ€™s Guild.

The Fol Thron branch of the Mageâ€™s Guild is a simple spire of brown
stone, crowned with what looks like an observatory. In any other
setting it would look tall and impressivle, although it looks
diminutive in the presence of the great Citadel.

The building is closed to all non-members, save for a few runners,
(young boys who loiter in the vestibule and wait for the chance to
deliver messages or goods around the city in exchange for a few
coppers) so Skeeveâ€™s membership is examined carefully before he is
allowed to enter.

The interior is ornate and comfortable. The floor is covered in fine
red carpet, and there are many expertly crafted chairs arranged in the
lobby area. As in the Archives, there is an impressive arc of windows
along one wall, filling the room with daylight. This main room seems
to be a place for reading and quiet conversation. A spiral stairway
leads up from this room as well, although Skeeve does not see where it
leads.

He meets a few of the local wizards. They seem to work here in the
city, although Skeeve doesnâ€™t learn who employs them or why. Skeeve
stands by the window and listens in on some local politics. It seems
several of the senior members of this guild office are excited about
the recently-won war. They are looking into opening up a new Guildhall
in Fort Boland once the post-war cleanup is complete. The conversation
seems to center on what sites would be most suitable for this, and who
would be in charge of it.

Skeeve meets a few prominent members and makes polite conversation,
but doesnâ€™t learn anything of real value. He doesnâ€™t mention the orb
or Mordan.

Having learned little, he bids the other wizards good-night and heads
back to the inn. Enoch shares the most recent chapters that heâ€™s
translated, which they ponder for a while before going to bed.
